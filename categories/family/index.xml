      <title>The Purpose of being a Parent</title>

      <description>When I was seventeen my father confessed, “Hey, I’ve never done this before. We are practicing on you.”. I think every parent on earth feels that way. We really have no idea what we are doing. Most of us are dealing with issues as they come by the seat of our pants. Even worse, the rules keep changing. And it doesn’t really matter how much experience or how many kids you have.</description>

      <title>Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind?</title>

      <description>As I fly over DFW airport, I can see downtown Fort Worth in the distance. I have 13 years worth of memories there that are surprisingly happy considering how eager I was to leave. I guess it is hard to fully appreciate something while you are experiencing it. The tendency, at least for me, is to move forward. I have been in pursuit of some ambitious goal ever since I was a boy.</description>

      <description>I was raised to respect my last name. I was taught to be proud of who we are and where we came from. When I was a kid, I thought that I was a member of a secret society. There was a strong sense of family. Being a part of it meant that you would never be alone. We loved each other and still do. I believed that if you shared my blood line then you were a step above.</description>

      <description>Some things quite clearly belong in this world. They come to us in a variety of different packages. We have experienced them at some point with all of our senses. They are easy to identify. When you see them, even for the first time, it is familiar. The taste and smell is pleasant. You could swear that you’ve heard them before. It just feels right. That is how I perceive art.</description>

      <title>A 3 year old Storm hit Montgomery, Tx</title>

      <description>The family and I made our way down to Montgomery, Texas a few weeks ago. We stayed with my cousin Rodney and his girlfriend Erin for nearly a week. Our goal was to convince them that they should never, ever for any reason have children. Not that there was any talk of kids. Ethan was only too eager to help prevent that conversation from ever happening, ever. Drew made a beeline to the back room where he holed away to play the XBox, rarely to be seen again.</description>

      <description>My hands slipped and the heavy desk slammed into my face. It’s free fall to the concrete was impeded only by this and a knee which is now bruised scarlet. I did manage to save the desk from harm. My face took the brunt of the damage. I stood there frowning as I looked at a split lip in the mirror and felt thankful. For one thing, I was physically capable of standing.</description>

      <description>After spending a few days in Yellowstone, it was time to head home. We decided to take a different route back in order to see more of the American west. We exited Yellowstone via the east entrance and took highway 16 to Cody, Wy. We continued on highway 16 with a little trepidation through the Bighorn mountains. We had read reports of sharp curves and steep roads that might tax the breaks.</description>

      <description>After travelling through five states in four days, we were finally at our destination, Yellowstone National Park. By this time we had a well established morning routine. At around 6AM, dad would come tip toeing through the RV attempting to exit without waking the boys (especially Ethan). I would get up and follow him out. We had a coffee pot pre-prepared the night before ready to be brewed. By the time it was ready, mom would join us also in need of caffeine.</description>

      <description>Driving through Wyoming is like touring a spaghetti western movie. At any moment I expected traditionally dressed Arapaho to come riding out on horseback. Dylan and Drew peered out the window, one of them exclaimed “this looks like Red Dead Redemption”. This truly was a perfect picture of how I have always envisioned the Old West high plains. This describes most of the terrain of Wyoming, that is until one reaches the mountains.</description>

      <description>The weather in Oklahoma and Texas leading up to our trip had been blistering hot. It was not at all uncommon for the temperature to reach 110 degrees. When we heard that it would almost certainly rain before we reached Colorado Springs most everyone rejoiced. However, when I looked over at dad he had no expression on his face at all. I asked “Do you think rain will be an issue?</description>

      <description>Day one of our trip to see Yellowstone had finally arrived. We could not have been more excited. Linda, Drew, Ethan and I arrived at my parents house in Anadarko, Ok on Sunday just in time for lunch. Dad and I began pre-departure inspections and were immediately faced with a dead main battery. We were able to get it started with a jump and after some fiddling determined that everything was fine.</description>

      <description>The terrain of the United States is a complete wonder to me. The aesthetic difference of the east coast from the west and everything in between is like night and day. It varies so much that it is hard to believe that it is all part of the same country. I believe it to be true that we are in part products of our environment. My upbringing in a small peanut and cotton farming community has vastly shaped my view of the world.</description>

      <description>Bluebonnet Elementary school treated the family of its students to an Open House Thursday evening. It was highly anticipated at our house and Drew seemed excited to show us what he had been working on at school. I was already somewhat aware of what I would be seeing as I had been helping him with one of his projects off an on for the prior week. It’s always fun to go to the school and see what the kids have been working on.</description>

      <description>The terms of surrender of private property and personal liberty were never fully agreed upon by all parties. Linda and I, henceforth known as “The parents”, have spent the better part of two years trying to ensure that the life, limb and property of a certain mister Ethan Craddock remain unmolested, much to his annoyance. He seems to consider himself a prisoner, the reluctant prisoner.
A few months ago an incident occurred that made us painfully aware of the drastic measures which needed to take place.</description>

      <description>After a full week of sitting at home due to snow days, life returned to some semblance or normalcy today. At this time last week the sleet was already beating down on my roof. I always work from the home office on Tuesdays but it was pretty apparent that none of us would be leaving the house the next day. This proved to be true for the rest of the week.</description>

      <description>For what felt like the first time in awhile during our Fiesta Bowl road trip, I woke up and everything was perfect. I took a shower and headed down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast and was greeted by several hotel guests donning Crimson and Cream. I was greeted on several occasions with a loud “BOOMER” which I of course replied with an equally loud “SOONER”. Everyone seemed as excited as we were.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to describe the feeling of elation that we all had as we drove away from Roswell in a brand new 2010 Toyota Camry on loan from the dealership. Not that Roswell was such a horrible place, but let’s face it, it is a town that is primarily known for the fact that some of its residents insisted that they had been visited by little green men. That is not exactly an indicator of high culture or sophistication, then again we were passing through there on our way to see grown men run up and down a patch of grass while trying to tackle each other.</description>

      <description>In case you missed it here is the story of the first day of our trip to Glendale Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl.
I woke up Friday morning worried and exhausted after enduring nightmares of our party stranded in the mountains, snowed in with a vehicle that would only travel 2 miles an hour. I was both thankful and terrified once I realized that we were still in Roswell and not about to endure a frigid winter that was sure to end in cannibalism and other unspeakable atrocities.</description>

      <description>There is nothing quite like a road trip across open country to clear your mind, open your eyes to the beauty of the world and test your patience with your travelling companions as well as your fellow occupants of the road.
After learning that a high school class mate of mine had tickets to the Fiesta Bowl for sale, I decided that I would use the remainder of my vacation time to take a trip to Glendale, Arizona and watch the Sooners redeem themselves from their recent BCS Bowl game slump.</description>

      <description>Football season is almost underway again and I have a new favorite team. I am now a die hard Chiefs fan. No not those Chiefs, I’m talking about my sons new football team the [RYA][1] Junior Chiefs. He has played for the bantam Panthers team for the last three years with plenty of ups and downs. Along the way Drew has experienced blood, sweat and tears. He went from mostly watching along the sidelines his first year to being Mr.</description>

      <description>6:15 AM : Rise and shine… er sort of. Drew awakens reluctantly
6:30 AM : Start the morning off right with a big bowl of sugar…. I mean cereal
6:45 AM : Get in the car and head towards our rendezvous point at Nathan’s house
6:46 AM : Check my text messages from the night before and see that I received a message at 2 AM cancelling….
Ok, so the morning didn’t start off quite the way that we had planned.</description>

      <description>so on the way home from work yesterday Nathan and I decided to stop smoking. I had two cigarretes left and it was about 4:30. I smoked the first one immediately after driving off after dropping him off at his house. I smoked the 2nd one at about 7:30 last night. I’ve been losing my mind ever since. By the way it should be noted that I got a text message from Nathan saying that he was not going to quit.</description>
