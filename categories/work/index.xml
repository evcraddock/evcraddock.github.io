      <description>When my son was about five years old, he asked me to play one of his games for him. He was stuck on a difficult level that he couldn’t beat. I wouldn’t help. I refused to play the game for him. I pointed out that if I beat the level than, I would be having the fun, not him. He decided not to play that game anymore. He said it wasn’t fun unless he was winning.</description>

      <title>How to beat burnout</title>

      <description>For the past few months, I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like writing. I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like working on anything really. It has been impossible to motivate myself. The [resistence] (https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/) has kicked my ass. I&amp;rsquo;ve been burned out. I actually started writing this post in July and put it down until now. Why did I allow this to happen? There are several reasons, none of them good.
What causes burnout? [Burnout] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout) is a form of depression caused by stress due to work.</description>

      <title>Don’t automate your life</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/05/dont-automate-life/</link>

      <description>TLDR; Don’t automate your life. Technology has evolved to the point to where it is almost possible to do just that. We rely on computers to think for us too much. It is causing our minds to atrophy. Spend your time learning and contributing to the world instead of constantly entertaining yourself.
Remembering Phone Numbers When I was a teenager, I could remember a telephone number like my wife now remembers my every mistake.</description>

      <title>How to Use Goals</title>

      <description>Every year in January a horde of people line up at the gym for that magical workout that will change their lives forever. They make grandiose promises of losing 50 pounds, giving up sugar, or quitting smoking. Of course by the 2nd week of January the gym is a ghost town, candy bar sales are through the roof and that pack of cigarettes became two. Why is it so hard to do what we know needs to be done?</description>

      <title>Goals and Plans for 2016</title>

      <description>When it came time to review how things went in 2015, I had a hard time. I had nothing to work with because I did not set any goals and plans at the beginning of the year. The only valuable thing I was able to do was list out the areas where I did not do so well. This year will be different. I have set a number of goals and plans for myself.</description>

      <title>Year in Review for 2015</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/12/2015-year-in-review/</link>

      <description>Year in Review summary In an effort to improve my life, I am publishing a year in review for 2015. Since I didn’t set any goals last year, it is a bit hard to grade my progress. So, before the year is over, I intend to set a few goals on what I want to improve next year. But first, I think it would help to summarize how i think things went in 2015.</description>

      <title>How To Get Things Done – GTD</title>

      <description>[Lists are how we track what we need to do] (/2013/07/29/an-overview-of-getting-things-done-lists/) but this alone is not enough. Despite an abundance of technology available to help us keep track of tasks, many of us still keep these lists in our heads. We do this for a variety of reasons. They all have a common root. We don’t trust our system. We don’t actually believe that the list is the full list. We know that things have either been forgotten to be put on the list or were not important enough to track.</description>

      <description>Getting Things Done is a task management system created by David Allen. Its purpose is to establish a framework for tracking tasks so that all necessary resources are available when and where they are needed. A primary focus is to ensure that the system can be trusted as the one source of anything that needs to be done. This is an overview of the system from my own point of view.</description>

      <title>How I Replaced Google Reader with Pinboard</title>

      <description>It’s been in the wind for a while. Fewer websites are explicitly offering RSS links. Instead they promote their content on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+. I only clung to RSS feeds this long because of the strength of Google Reader. I used it constantly. It was my primary link to the Internet. I was subscribed to about 50 different feeds grouped up into about 10 different folders.</description>

      <title>Lower back pain in the ass</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2013/02/lower-back-pain-in-the-ass/</link>

      <description>I sit on my ass approximately 15 hours a day. Can you believe that? Doesn’t that seem a tad excessive? I’m only awake around 18 hours. At first when I did the math, I thought that I must have made a mistake. Nope, I easily sit that long. I guess I wouldn’t care except that recently I’ve started to feel pain in my lower back. Ok, recently is a lie. This back pain has been going on for about six months.</description>

      <description>There is a big difference between knowing what to do and actually doing it. It is easy to wastespend a lot time learning how to use it efficiently. There are dozens of time management systems out there. The one thing that they all have in common is a need of consistency. In order for a time management system to improve your life, you must consistently use it. In other words, you must build habits.</description>
