      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like writing. I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like working on anything really. It has been impossible to motivate myself. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/&#34;&gt;resistence&lt;/a&gt; has kicked my ass. I&amp;rsquo;ve been burned out. I actually started writing this post in July and put it down until now. Why did I allow this to happen? There are several reasons, none of them good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-causes-burnout&#34;&gt;What causes burnout?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout&#34;&gt;Burnout&lt;/a&gt; is a form of depression caused by stress due to work. It is usually associated with working too much. A stereo typical scenario might involve an employee that spends too many straight hours working on a project. Because of this, he fails to maintain the proper work-life balance and gets worn out. He is unable to show passion for his work and the quality suffers. The traditional solution is to take more frequent vacations and learn to balance work and life more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this scenario seems plausible, even typical, it is not what happens to me. I do not think that work-life balance has much to do with getting burned out. There are plenty of people who dedicate their every waking moment to work without experiencing it. We celebrate them. There is a long list of celebrities from sports stars to CEOs that admit to spending a dozen hours a day working. They keep it up for months or even years. How do they avoid burning out? What makes them different than the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the primary cause of burnout is not that you work too many hours. It is that you don&amp;rsquo;t make enough meaningful progress. It happens to me for following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-goals-seem-unreachable&#34;&gt;My goals seem unreachable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am constantly in the middle of some big project. I&amp;rsquo;ll get excited about something, start working on it, and eventually fizzle out. To fight against this tendency, I organize. I &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/02/plan-to-succeed/&#34;&gt;set goals and make plans&lt;/a&gt; to achieve them. I decide at the beginning of each week what I intend to accomplish. Unfortunately, I usually end up biting off more than I can chew. In theory, I will get better at breaking big tasks into small tasks and prioritizing them. In practice, I get stuck. For whatever reason, I can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish the task. Maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or where to even start. When weeks go by without much progress, I get discouraged. Doubt creeps in and the easiest thing to do is nothing at all. It starts with one issue and eventually affects my whole life for weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-can-t-control-something-i-care-about&#34;&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t control something I care about&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I am not in control of what happens in most of the world. It seems like a lot of people make a lot of bad decisions. Dealing with the  consequences of other people&amp;rsquo;s choices is very hard for me. Sometimes, it is painfully obvious that it is just time to move on. If your boss is abusive and you hate your job, it is easy to decide to quit. If you are in an abusive relationship with someone that you do not love, again that seems like an easy decision even if taking action is scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard decision is when you love your job and your boss, but he or she is making bad decisions. It is when you can&amp;rsquo;t imagine being alive without your spouse but you have differing opinions on major issues. Sometimes fate just deals you a bad hand. A disease, an accident or a disaster might happen to you, or worse someone you love. These things are hard to deal with. This is what gets most of us. This is how good people lose themselves and those they love. This is how people get worn down and burned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;not-taking-care-of-myself&#34;&gt;Not taking care of myself&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unreachable goals and a lack of control are almost always how I get to burned out. Not taking care of myself is how I stay there. It is no coincidence that my most productive times have been when I was eating right and exercising. We all know it. We are always on the lookout for the magical diet that is easy and works every time. We want an easy solution but almost anything good comes with some level of suffering. Bad health and depression work hand in hand. The more unhealthy you are the more depressed you feel. The more depressed you feel the harder it is to eat right and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-beat-burnout&#34;&gt;How to beat burnout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret to beating burnout is to always make progress. Only plan work that you know you can accomplish. Focus on improving. Instead of setting goals, have dreams. Create habits. Put systems in place that are aimed at fulfilling your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, focus on your health. Feeling good will make everything else come easier. If you are already in good health, then focus on your health anyway. Take it to the next level. Sign up for a marathon or something. If you are like me and staying healthy is a lifelong struggle then do whatever you can. Again, make progress. Start with eliminating sugar and soda. If you have an addiction such as smoking, do not quit right off the bat. That is asking for trouble, frustration and probably failure. Start small and work up to that. Never stop improving your health, one achievable step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your work, don&amp;rsquo;t think about the big picture during the week. Don&amp;rsquo;t second guess yourself. Do your work even if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it. Next, if you don&amp;rsquo;t finish a task on time, break it down into smaller tasks. Most of the time we get stuck because we aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what to do next. Finally, be honest with yourself. If several weeks have gone by and you still haven&amp;rsquo;t progressed, drop it. Quit, you aren&amp;rsquo;t that into it. You will feel much better when you focus on something that you actually care about. You may have fallen in love with the idea of a project. If you discover that you hate the work involved, then quit working on that project. Don&amp;rsquo;t let inner turmoil derail your entire life. It will if you let it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, never give someone or something else control of your happiness. Either accept your situation or change it. Don&amp;rsquo;t complain. It will only lead to bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only do work that you care about. Never work for money. Getting paid should be a byproduct of doing your job, not the reason. Many people think that they are not in control of their job, especially when they answer to a boss. This is simply not true. If you are at odds with your boss or a co-worker, the first thing to do is assume that you are wrong. Try to imagine a scenario where they are right. If you are unable to do this, gather data. Usually, if you have enough data on your side and you are right, a tactful conversation will win the day. If it does not, you must choose: accept it, or move on and do something else. Do not pretend to accept it if you can not. This will lead to not giving a shit otherwise known as burnout. If you really feel that you have no say in what you do, find a different job. It isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to have control is to take the blame. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t your fault than how can you fix it? When a problem is someone else&amp;rsquo;s fault, they own it. They are responsible for it. You are the helpless victim. The best way to get stuck is to pin your success on someone else. It is hard to make progress when you are working on someone else&amp;rsquo;s schedule. Having someone else to blame won&amp;rsquo;t get you any closer to done. Instead, look for things that you could have done differently. Take responsibility and be creative. Again, never blame anyone for anything. At the very least it was your fault for relying on someone that you can&amp;rsquo;t control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I may be the last person in the world with the right to give advice on avoiding burnout. Then again, I have plenty of experience with it. As the classic Type A personality, I tend to push myself hard. When things don&amp;rsquo;t work out as planned, I end up depressed. I fill my time over reading and playing video games or something similar. I feel that following the guidelines above is how I can avoid burnout. I hope that you find it valuable as well. I am curious to know how other people deal with this problem. If anyone has advice or thinks that I am off base, I would love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I consume the Internet</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/06/29/how-i-consume-the-internet/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/06/29/how-i-consume-the-internet/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I am an information junkie. I go from one obsession to the next. The Internet deals me out a constant supply of articles, images, music and video on any and every subject I can imagine. It is very easy to get sucked in. If I&amp;rsquo;m not careful I will find myself reading about some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?178939-8-Most-Bizarre-Religious-Rites&#34;&gt;obscure religious rite&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/seahorse-reproduction-behavior-conservation/&#34;&gt;mating habits of deep sea creatures&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fanfiction.net/u/55503/Electric-Monk&#34;&gt;Neuromancer fan fiction&lt;/a&gt;. Every subject is represented. There are niche groups living within niche groups. Unbelievably, there is just too much information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2013/04/how-i-replaced-google-reader-with-pinboard/&#34;&gt;dealing with this issue&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. We all deal with it to varying degrees. It is necessary to limit ourselves or we will be on the Internet all day. Some of us have to go to work and food is nice from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we deal with it? We can&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it. Every year, more jobs revolve around data from the Internet. My job certainly does. I am a software developer, a field that is constantly changing. If I don&amp;rsquo;t keep myself informed, I will soon find my skills irrelevant. It&amp;rsquo;s not just my job that is effected. In fact, almost every aspect of my life is improved by consuming information on the Internet. What is the best music or movies out right now? What advances in technology have been made? How much are Bitcoins selling for? Will George R.R. Martin ever relase the next Song of Ice and Fire book? Pretty sure the answer is no, he&amp;rsquo;s just going to let HBO write it for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
### Past attempts at solving the problem
 Below are a few.

* **Google Reader**
    was my RSS reader of choice until it was shutdown in 2013. Each day, usually in the morning, I would scan the posts of each feed and star anything that looked interesting. This supplied me with an almost never ending list of posts to read. My favorite features was Reader&#39;s ability to view the contents of a post from within the application. It stripped out most of the formatting and the ads and left me with simple readable text.

    There were a few drawbacks. It wasn&#39;t always possible to view a website from within Reader. Video was not supported. Also it wasn&#39;t possible to star articles from outside of a feed subscribed to through Reader.
* **Pinboard / Twitter**
    was how I initially replaced Google Reader. Pinboard is an application that allows you to create bookmarks by tagging links on the Internet. The primary feature that convinced me to use pinboard was it&#39;s ability to interact with other applications. There were several plugins that worked with popular web application. One of them was a Google Chrome plugin that let me mark any article that I came across as something I wanted to read later. The primary way that I discovered new content was Twitter. I followed people who wrote about subjects that I was interested in and bookmarked them. I could then get a list of articles that I wanted to read on Pinboard.

    Pinboard&#39;s mobile application allowed me to view simplified versions of my bookmarks much like Google Reader. Unfortunately this feature wasn&#39;t implemented for the web application. I had to open each site in a new tab and remember to close it later. The other problem with this solution was Twitter. Even though everyone posted links to their Twitter stream, they also tweeted random thoughts and other texts that I had to sift through. I eventually looked for a new solution because this one was just too much of a pain in the ass.
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am faced with a horrible realization. There isn&amp;rsquo;t enough time in the day to consume everything on the Interet that interests me. I must limit myself or at least be more efficient. To maximize my time, I have devised a system for managing all of the articles, videos and images that I want to view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-tools&#34;&gt;My Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSS Reader&lt;/strong&gt; -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goread.io/&#34;&gt;GoRead&lt;/a&gt; is an RSS reader that was created to replace all of the funcitonality of Google Reader, which was shutdown in 2013. Where most RSS readers that I have found try to be everything for everyone, GoRead does one thing good. It lets you subscribe to and view RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmark Browser Plugin&lt;/strong&gt; -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj&#34;&gt;Save to Pocket&lt;/a&gt; is a browser extension for Chrome which adds a button next to the address bar used to tag links to read later with Pocket. The extension also adds a context menu item when you two finger tap a link using a Mac or right click using Windows. Another cool feature of the extension is the keyboard shortcut for saving a link. It is by default Command+Up+P for the Mac and Ctrl+Shift+S for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Later List&lt;/strong&gt; -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; allows you to tag links and save them for later use but I typically use the default list as a list of web pages on the Internet that I intend to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article Viewer&lt;/strong&gt; -
Pocket lets me view articles three different ways: &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com&#34;&gt;web application&lt;/a&gt;, mobile application: &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/read-it-later-pro/id309601447?mt=8&#34;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, native &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/pocket/id568494494?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=12&#34;&gt;OSX application&lt;/a&gt;. Each gives me a list of links that I previously saved. When I click on a link, Pocket allows me to read using article view or web view. Article view cleans up the page so that it is mostly text. Web view displays the full website. If I am using the web application, web view open the link in a new tab. For both the native OSX and mobile applications, web view displays within the Pocket application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-daily-process&#34;&gt;My Daily Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; -
    At least once a day, using my RSS reader, I browse through new items by category. If the title looks interesting, I right click on the link and select &amp;ldquo;Save to Pocket&amp;rdquo;. On some occassions, I save a link to the read later list based entirely on the author. For example, I read everything Seth Godin writes. I also check sites like Reddit, Medium and Twitter a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browsing&lt;/strong&gt; -
    Througout the day as I am browsing the Internet, I may come across something that looks interesting. I am able to save a bookmark using the Pocket bookmarking browser plugin. It keeps the popup window open long enough to allow me to tag the link if I care to. I can trigger saving the link to Pocket by either clicking on the extenion&amp;rsquo;s button next to the address bar or by the keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt; -
    Whenever I am in the mood to read, I can open up Pocket using either the web, mobile or native OSX application. If I am using either the mobile or native application, the article displays in a frame with a button bar that lets me either archive, trash, tag or set the link as a favorite. Once I&amp;rsquo;m done reading, I tag and archive the article if I think it has future value. Otherwise I trash the document. I have yet to use the favorite feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;missing-features&#34;&gt;Missing Features&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As easy and convenient as this system is, there are still some features that are missing that would make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSS feeds for Tags&lt;/strong&gt; -
There should be a way to tag a link on the internet and then subscribe to an RSS feed based on the tag. I use my RSS reader as a discovery application. Now, when I tag a link it goes straight to my read later list. If I could subscribe to a tag feed I could add to this list without having to decide to actually read the article or not. I could decide later during my actually discovery process. This would allow me to tag links without putting much thought into if I cared to read it later. I could tag links based off of many different criteria such as subject, author, or who recommended the link. It would be nice to have the ability to quickly tag links that might remind me of why I was interested in the subject in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link priority&lt;/strong&gt; -
It would be nice if I could prioritize how interested I was in a link. There are times when a certain link makes it to the front of the list and I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to read it, but I do want to read it eventually. There should a way to push it to the back of the list or at least further down the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am constantly tweaking this system of consuming data on the Internet. New tools come out all of the time, hopefully someone will create a way of fixing the missing features I mentioned. If you have a better system, I would love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to read.  I read so much that sometimes I worry about how healthy it might be. When I am in need of a good book I ask my friends. So it is only fair that I also recommend the books that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don’t automate your life</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/05/02/dont-automate-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/05/02/dont-automate-life/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Don’t automate your life. Technology has evolved to the point to where it is almost possible to do just that.  We rely on computers to think for us too much. It is causing our minds to atrophy. Spend your time learning and contributing to the world instead of constantly entertaining yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;remembering-phone-numbers&#34;&gt;Remembering Phone Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, I could remember a telephone number like my wife now remembers my every mistake. It was uncanny. There were probably a dozen numbers that I just knew off the top of my head. Today, I probably couldn’t tell you my own phone number much less anyone else’s. Yes, I know. I’m getting older but I don’t think my age is the culprit. I’ve delegated the job of remembering phone numbers to my phone. Just click on a face and voila!, their phone rings, or more likely, their profile pops up and I can text message them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seem that more and more we are giving the job of remembering things over to our phones and computers. And why not, a computer is much better at managing information than we are. Computers are better than us at lots of things now and the list is growing everyday.  I have a hard time thinking of anything that we don’t use computers to help with at least a little. For the most part, I think that it is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-technology&#34;&gt;The Evolution of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire history of mankind has been a series of ideas that have literally changed the world. We use our minds to create technology that makes our lives easier. The very concept of thought is itself a man made technology. It is what sets us apart from the other animals. It is what makes us human. I believe that the evolution of humanity and the evolution of technology are one and the same. It would be virtually impossible to describe the human condition without discussing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how far should we take it? How much is too much? Are we too dependant on technology? I can remember a time before cell phones and personal computers. My father remembers there being no indoor plumbing. My grandparents grew up without electricity. Every generation has a few more luxuries than the one before. Each generation would have a difficult time surviving with the resources their grandparents lived with. The quality of life seems to be increasing for everyone despite what the newspapers and websites sell. But at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more functions we hand over to a computer, the less necessary we ourselves become. Have you ever seen someone who had one of their arms or legs immobilized for an extended period of time? Have you seen what it does to the damaged appendage? The unused muscles atrophy and become weak. It takes a lot of physical therapy for it to get back in shape. The same happens to a mind when you stop using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-your-brain-works&#34;&gt;How your brain works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t try to accurately explain how the brain works, because frankly I can’t. But generally speaking, the human brain consists of trillions of synapses which are like tiny contact points. As we experience life or learn new things neurons are fired that make connections between these synapses. This is basically the mechanism the brain uses to remember information. It is the physical manifestation of intelligence. The more connections the more intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a process called neuroplasticity, the brain reorganizes itself to find the quickest path to the information that is accessed the most. It works on a use it or lose it basis.  If, for example, you spend a lot of time watching episodes of the Walking Dead than your brain will make sure that you have details about Rick Grimes handy. On the other hand, if you had lost interest in Star Trek and didn’t watch it for a few years, you may have trouble remembering that Captain Kirk’s middle name is Tiberius and that he was an Admiral for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;remembering-phone-number-revisited&#34;&gt;Remembering Phone Number Revisited&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to phone numbers, I can’t remember phone numbers any more because I don’t need to. My brain no longer devotes neurons to remembering phone numbers. Why should it when that information can be conjured up on my phone’s screen in moments. I think that it is a good trade off. There are much better ways that I can utilize my mental resources. This way I have more capacity available to learn more awesome stuff. The problem is that a lot of us don’t invest that extra capacity wisely. Instead, we devote it to entertaining ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-world-full-of-technology&#34;&gt;A World full of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where new technology spawns like a gremlin dunked in the ocean. We have gadgets that can do just about anything although sometimes it feels like some of them have been fed after midnight. Life has become so much easier. Google search alone has almost entirely replaced the need to remember anything. We have automated everything from paying our bills to scheduling our daily lives. Artificial Intelligence is being injected into everything. If it requires a little work or thought, I promise that there is some enterprising entrepreneur working on a solution. We are in the process of replacing the human work force with machines at an exponential rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have self driving vehicles, AI automated investing and drones that can deliver packages to your doorstep. If you are fortunate enough to have a job, it is very possible to spend your days following orders at work and your nights being entertained by television without ever personally contributing anything to the world. I don’t mean to get all philosophical but eventually I can’t help but wonder what the point is. Are we really meant to live out our lives just trying to stay as comfortable as we can until we eventually die? I refuse to believe that life is meant to be treated a like a frickin hospice plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t automate your life! Do things for yourself. Don’t let your mind atrophy. Learn as much as you can. Spend your life creating the things that you love and share them with the world. We very well may be on the highway to hell that leads to some kind of cyborg society where computers and human minds meld into one. But we aren’t there yet. I personally believe that technology will only make life better. But even if I’m wrong, it certainly isn’t going away. So use it, but don’t allow technology to replace your purpose in this world, instead use it to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet Good People Online</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/04/10/meet-good-people-online/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I think that it’s possible to meet good people online without feeling like a creep and with very little risk. I think that the key to making friends online is by spending time with them offline. Conventional knowledge tells us that meeting people in person that we met on the Internet is a bad idea and potentially dangerous. I believe that I know how to solve that problem. Below are my ideas for using the Internet to safely meet people who are worth friendship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/03/how-we-meet-people/&#34;&gt;I have mentioned in the past&lt;/a&gt;, typically when we meet people, it is because we share an interest or a situation. This is the key. Any system that helps people meet will revolve around the events that they have in common. In order to manage the quality of the people we meet, we must manage the events where we meet them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trusted-host&#34;&gt;Trusted Host&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;To feel comfortable attending an event, we must trust that the other people attending are decent. How can you gain that trust when dealing with strangers? The best way is if there is a person that you both know and trust. Think about the initial conversations that you typically have with a stranger. They usually turn into efforts at finding things you have in common,  “Where are you from?”,  “Oh, really, do you know so and so?” Etc. If that doesn’t result in a match we move on to common interests by asking questions like “What do you do?”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For this event management system to work, it is important that there is a host with a good reputation. The host is responsible for making sure that everything runs smoothly and that there are no assholes. The more a host is respected, the more likely people will be to risk their time attending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vetting-system&#34;&gt;Vetting System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In order to ensure that the right people attend, I propose a vetting system. Instead of sending out invitations, the host would share information about the event online. This would be either on social media or with a search engine that is dedicated to the type of event being held. People who are interested in attending would request an invitation. The host would be responsible for choosing the right people. The host could make that decision anyway they see fit. I suspect that a decision would be made based on the following criteria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Personal friend of the host&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Past attendee with a good reputation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Reference from a trusted friend of the host&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Reference from a past attendee with good reputation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Acquaintance of the host&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Person with an interesting profile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;It might go without saying, but the event would be for a specific purpose. It might be to eat a certain type of food that the host makes. It could be to watch a sporting event on television. My favorite is a house party to listen to a local band. Again, the idea is to meet cool people who have similar interests as you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reputation&#34;&gt;Reputation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;It should be possible for both the host and an attendee to build a reputation.  Everyone involved should be able to rate each other. Not only does it make it easier to get an invitation to another event, it also gives everyone an incentive to behave. If someone makes an ass of themselves at an event, they are less likely to get invited in the future. The person looks bad and it reflects poorly on the host that invited them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assumptions&#34;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;That is the basic idea for how to meet good people online in its raw form. I’ve made several assumptions that need to be tested. The biggest is, do people need help making friends? If so, are they worried about safety? Would a person be willing to request an invitation to a party? Would a host be interested in being choosy about who attends their event? Would attendees actually rate each other? Would an attendee agree to have their rating published for future hosts to see?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-application&#34;&gt;An Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The best way to test these assumptions is to actually build a web or mobile application and ask people to start using it. In lean startup language, a minimum viable product needs to be created. This application would allow a host to create and manage an event. A feature would exist to make it easy to publish the details to a social media site. Anyone interested in attending can see the host&amp;#8217;s rating / reputation. The person would click on the shared link to request an invitation. The host could optionally require that information such as a questionnaire be submitted to help with the vetting process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Each person that requests an invitation will be listed for approval by the host. The host will be able to review any past ratings that the person may have. Once they are approved, an email will be sent with the details of the event such as where it will be held. Once a person has been invited, they will be able to see the profiles of the other people who received an invitation. When the event is over each person will be able to leave comments and ratings for the host and everyone who attended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The next step is to begin building the application. I will update this website as I make progress. If would like me to notify you as I post updates please send me your email address by filling out the form below. Please contact me if you want to help or if you have any suggestions or criticisms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How We Meet People</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;did-facebook-do-us-a-favor&#34;&gt;Did Facebook do us a favor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that social media websites, like Facebook, are ruining social interactions. I have always been of the opinion that these websites make it easy to know enough about your friends so that you never need to speak to them again. Usually, when I see a friend we discuss what happened since we saw each other last. That is hardly necessary when you are kept informed in real time of their day to day experiences. On top of that, it’s not unusual to learn that you really don’t have much in common with your friends. Or that honestly, you don’t like them. There is something about an open forum that brings out the worst in people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe, social media websites just brought out in the open a problem that we’ve always had but never noticed. Maybe, those friends that we only interact with on Twitter aren’t really our friends. Maybe, that buddy with the radical political opinion just doesn’t have the nerve to bring it up in person. Would that make him any less of a tool? Maybe, Facebook did us a favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meeting-people-is-hard&#34;&gt;Meeting people is hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I am a bit of a homebody. I don’t like to get out that much. Having to smile and politely greet people sounds like a nightmare. It is so rare that I find other human beings that I have something in common with. Although, that could very well be because of how little I get out. The one friend that I actually make an effort to hang out with might be more antisocial than me. I just don’t know how to meet people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I believe that it is healthy to socialize with other people. There are plenty of studies that all but prove that an active social life will make you live longer. The problem is that most people I meet are either shallow, temperamental or unreliable, or all of the above. I wonder how I seem to them? What I really need is a way to meet other people in person with similar interests that aren’t assholes. It would be nice if these people were also looking for friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-perfect-solutions&#34;&gt;No perfect solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There are solutions to this problem but none of them completely work for me. There are lots of websites out there specifically designed to help you find that special somebody. I’m not interested in that. I already found my special somebody. I have been married to her for seventeen years. There are no services that I am aware of that help people look for just a normal friend. Probably because that sounds kind of pathetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;When you meet a new person it is either because you have a common interest or situation. Depending on where you meet, there may also be certain behaviors that are appropriate. Generally speaking, the places that expect appropriate behaviors are safer than those with fewer expectations of proper etiquette. A lot of the time this means that you don’t really get to know a person as they are. Instead, you get a situationally appropriate version of them.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;places-we-meet-people&#34;&gt;Places we meet people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Here are a few examples of safe places where people typically meet other people: work, church, school, &lt;a href=&#34;http://yonomitt.com/blog/2016/3/23/meeting-people-is-easy-but-hard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conventions&lt;/a&gt;, or an event for their kids such as a baseball game etc. These are all locations where you should probably bring, at most, your rated PG personality. You are less likely to get into a fight at these places although you might watch out for some of those soccer moms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Other places to meet people might be: parties, bars, clubs or concerts for example. It is probably ok to let your hair down here but these are also some of the riskier locations. It is rare to get a DUI coming home from church, not so much from the bar. Remember, Uber is your friend. Also, don’t expect much stimulating conversation unless you are particularly fascinated with television, fashion, sports or Donald Trump. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meeting-people-online-is-creepy&#34;&gt;Meeting people online is creepy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;If you are looking for a lively debate, look no further than the Internet. You can find plenty of it online in forums or social media. The Internet has added all kinds of variety when it comes to meeting people. Of all the social networks, Twitter is the only one that I think you can reasonably meet new people. In my experience the others, notably Facebook, are just places where we keep track of the friends we meet in person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The main problem with meeting people on the Internet is that you can never be sure who they are. The anonymous nature of the Internet is a honeypot for the worst sorts of sociopaths. Nowhere is this more true than in multiplayer games and online forums like reddit. You can never be sure who you are actually dealing with or what kind of sick game they may be playing. The Internet may be super convenient but it can also be a very creepy way of meeting people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There are services that combine both the risks of meeting online and meeting in person. Dating sites like eHarmony are probably the safest but as I mentioned before, I don’t want a date. It is also possible to find groups on Craig’s list or sites like meetup.com. The problem is that you don’t know what you are getting into until you get there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-we-do-about-it&#34;&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;So what is the answer? Is it possible to meet real people, who aren’t putting on a show, without risking boredom, a DUI, or possibly your life?  Surely there must be some safe way to use the Internet to improve the way we meet people in person. I think that this is a problem that is worth solving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;So to sum it up, I think there needs to be an online service. This service should make it safe and easy to meet other people, in person. It should not focus on romance and it should not be creepy. How hard could it be? Anyone else have any thoughts? Does this service already exist? Who wants to help me build it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plan to Succeed</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/02/28/plan-to-succeed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/02/28/plan-to-succeed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the time, we set ourselves up for failure. We set goals in order to please someone else. We plan for things that we aren’t ready to tackle. We try to do too much. These are recipes for failure. If you are going to set goals, make sure that they are achievable. Spend some time figuring out what you need to do. Determine what success looks like and make plans. Otherwise you are likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting goals is the process of identifying the things that you want to do. Planning is the process of managing the things that you want to do. If you are anything like me, you have way more that you want to do than time to do it. If you are not careful, you’ll try to start working on everything and end up finishing nothing. Of course the answer is to plan. This is how I manage the things that I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/01/how-to-use-goals/&#34;&gt;As I have mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, I like to group my goals up into three different categories: long term, yearly and quarterly. Long term and yearly goals are really too far away for much planning. There is still too much time for everything to go to hell. However, a quarterly goal is really just a project. These are things that need to be done that are comprised of more than one action. Some projects are more strictly defined than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that I am working towards my goals, I perform a review process at predefined times during the year. The review process is the secret sauce for creating a plan that stays relevant throughout the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Sunday I sit down and go through a review process. First, I go over what I accomplished the week before. I try to identify either why I was able or unable to finish what I had planned. I look at what I have left to do and decide whether I still want to do it. I also look over my “Waiting” list and decide if any other action needs to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I take a look at my goals for this quarter. I look at the projects and make sure that they are prioritized correctly. I take pains to avoid moving anything to or from the list of projects for this quarter. The Weekly review session is not the time to change quarterly goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, I choose a project to work on. This should be the first item in the prioritized project list. Occassionaly that isn’t practical due to whatever is going on that week. Once I decide what projects to work on, I must break things up into actionable tasks. I store tasks in two different lists. I have a “To Do” list for everything I intend to do this week, and a “Doing” list for what I am doing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are more tasks for a project than can be finished in a week. In that case, I leave the extra tasks attached to the project in the Quarterly goals list. For those times when I finish more than I expect, these are the tasks that I usually do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conduct a monthly review on either the first or last Sunday of every month. I choose the Sunday that is closer to the first day of the month. For example this month I will do my monthly review today since the first lands on a Tuesday. If the first was on a Friday, I would do my monthly review on the third day of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review is a bit more elaborate version of my weekly review. The major difference is that I allow myself to add or remove a goal that I had set for this quarter. The added goal still needs to work towards accomplishing one of my yearly goals. The monthly review process is not the time to change yearly goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarterly Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every three months, I have a quarterly review. As you will suspect, this review is much like the monthly review. I still do everything that I would do in a weekly review except that I allow myself to change yearly goals. I do not allow myself to change long term goals. The quarterly review process is not the time to change long term goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that I allow myself to change goals at predefined times during the year is to allow for some flexibility. I personally need a bend but don’t break strategy for accomplishing goals. I have such a wide variety of interests that it doesn’t take much to derail me from everything that I have planned. On the other hand, sometimes things just don’t work out. It is ridiculous to continue working on something that obviously isn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yearly Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the yearly review, I reevaluate all of my goals. &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/12/2015-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;I think about the prior year&lt;/a&gt; in terms of what worked and what did not work so well. I put some thought into what I want to accomplish both now and in the future. &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/01/goals-and-plans-2016/&#34;&gt;Last year I spent about a week&lt;/a&gt; going through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the time to change those long term goals. Sometimes after spending a significant amount of time working on something it becomes clear that it isn’t a good fit. It is difficult to give up on a goal that you have worked hard to accomplish. I always remind myself that setting goals and making plans is something that I do to make my life better. If at any time I feel like I have become a slave to the processes that I set up, then it is time to change. But only at the predefined intervals that I set beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use Goals</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/01/25/how-to-use-goals/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Every year in January a horde of people line up at the gym for that magical workout that will change their lives forever. They make grandiose promises of losing 50 pounds, giving up sugar, or quitting smoking. Of course by the 2nd week of January the gym is a ghost town, candy bar sales are through the roof and that pack of cigarettes became two. Why is it so hard to do what we know needs to be done? It’s not like it’s someone else’s problem that we are being asked to care about. In fact, typically people are much better at doing the work that is important to someone else, such as their boss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The problem is a lack of planning. If you don’t plan your life, someone will plan it for you, more than likely your boss. Without a plan, all you can do is fumble around in the dark dealing with issues as they occur. It is virtually impossible to accomplish anything substantial without a certain amount of organization. But to keep track of what you need to do, you must know what you need to do. You must have a goal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-goals-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A goal is a desired result. It’s a mission. It is a dream. When you look to the future and imagine how things could be, that is a goal. It doesn’t matter if that is for tomorrow, later this year or sometime before you die. Goals are how we plan for the future. To me, it makes sense to list goals into three different groups: Long Term, Yearly and Quarterly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Term Goals&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;are used for direction. They serve as a compass for everything we plan to do. These are the list of outcomes that we hope to achieve someday. They don’t have to be specific but they should be measurable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There needs to be some solid definition, so that you know when you are done. For example, if the goal is to be healthy, how will you know when you are successful? Your definition for healthy will change over time. Mine changes every morning right before it is time to head to the gym. That is when I feel so healthy that the gym seems unnecessary. Don’t set “healthy” as your goal. It is better to set a certain weight, or some other attribute like six pack abs. Then, there will be no question as to whether you met the goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A long term goal should be hard but achievable. It should act as a guide for all of your yearly and quarterly goals. It should not be a stepping stone to something bigger. The bigger goal itself is your long term goal. I break mine up into five different categories: Health, Family, Professional, Personal and Financial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yearly Goals&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;are the major achievements that you want to accomplish this year. Each of them should bring you closer to fulfilling a long term goal. Bonus points for the yearly goal that counts towards multiple long term goals. If you find yourself planning something that is unrelated to a long term goal, you know there is a problem. Where is the disconnect? Did you not fully identify your long term goals? Does it make sense to do this work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Be careful not to bite off more than you can chew. It is better to keep your load manageable, especially at first. It is much easier to give up, if you fall hopelessly behind. That is less likely to happen if you start off small. In another post, I will describe the mechanism I use for changing goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;On the other hand, don’t be so easy on yourself that there is no challenge. Achieving all of your goals in the first months of the year defeats the purpose. There will always be pressing things to do. If you don’t have any goals you will have no viable way of prioritizing what you do. You will essentially be back to dealing with issues as they occur. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarterly Goals&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;are the ones that are in the crosshairs. These are goals in which we can identify specifics. If a long term goal is a dream and a yearly goal is a mission then a quarterly goal is a project. You should have a pretty clear idea of how you will accomplish a quarterly goal. It is no longer a dream. It is now simply work that needs to be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For example, if your long term goal is to major in a specific study in college, you may decide to take certain classes your first year. But each semester you actually enroll in those classes. You then know exactly when to attend class and which books are required. This isn’t some pie in the sky fantasy. You have committed to taking these classes and there are consequences if you do not. To a freshman attending the first class of the semester, the idea of a degree may seem unreal or even impossible. But of course it isn’t, graduation will come one semester at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-in-conclusion-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There is no shortage of techniques for keeping track of what you need to do. I use a process that is based off the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2013/08/25/how-to-get-things-done/&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done by David Allen&lt;/a&gt;. All of the planning in the world is a waste of time if you don’t have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish. It is easy to let your agenda be set by the people around you. It is easy to spend all of your time putting out fires. It might be better to let some things burn. Who knows, maybe a new hero is just waiting for the chance to champion that cause. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The most insidious villain in my life is me. I constantly have new ideas that I let derail what I am currently working on. Writing down long term, yearly and quarterly goals reminds me of why I am doing what I am doing. I feel like I am fulfilling a purpose when I force myself to keep my projects based on my current goals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Setting goals is not a one and done ordeal. Life is not static and neither are your goals. However, there is a balance. You shouldn’t change goals on a whim but they also shouldn’t be so set in stone that they no longer align with who you are. This is where a planning system comes in play. &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/02/plan-to-succeed/&#34;&gt;My next post will be the nuts and bolts of how to plan projects and manage goals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goals and Plans for 2016</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;When it came time to &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/12/30/2015-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;review how things went in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I had a hard time. I had nothing to work with because I did not set any goals and plans at the beginning of the year. The only valuable thing I was able to do was list out the areas where I did not do so well. This year will be different. &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/01/24/how-to-use-goals/&#34;&gt;I have set a number of goals&lt;/a&gt; and plans for myself.  At the end of the year, I will be able to compare my goals and plans with what I actually achieved.  This time next year, I should be able to look back and see how I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I jotted down a few of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/12/30/2015-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;mistakes I made last year&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that I can avoid most of these by looking ahead and planning. One of the problems I had was allowing myself to get over extended. I started too many different major projects without completing them. I am going to remedy this by committing to fewer projects this coming year. I will also not allow myself to abandon a project so easily. I will only let myself change a goal once a quarter and only if there is a compelling reason. If I do decide to back out, I will write about it here. This will allow someone to call bullshit if it is not for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of what I do involves my family. When it came time to set goals and plans, there was no way to do it alone. Linda and I spent about two days writing down both long term goals and goals for the upcoming year. Some of them are personal but many can only be achieved together. We broke them up into a few different categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;As I get older and my body starts failing on me, I have become more interested in my health. I haven’t always taken care of myself properly. I have done much better in the last few years. In March, it will be 7 years since I quit smoking. That was a bad habit that had me trapped for nearly 20 years. I currently find myself in as good of shape as I’ve been since high school, but I’m still overweight by at least 15 pounds. At 5’11, I should weigh no more than 175 pounds and I am currently at 190.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-gym-and-keto-diet-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Gym and Keto Diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I don’t want to only lose weight. I also want to gain muscle and feel good. I want to be generally healthy.  My sister and mother have been “encouraging” me to try the Keto diet. For the most part it has helped me lose weight. This time last year I weighed closer to 215. For those of you unfamiliar with the Keto diet, in a nutshell, it is a high fat, low carb, medium protein diet. My mother can explain it better than me. You can read her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ketogranny.diet/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Keto Granny blog to learn more&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-food-and-supplement-tracking-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Food and Supplement Tracking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Now, I did have a run in with gout that nearly killed me. No exaggeration, I was willing to have my foot amputated at one point. I can’t really blame the Keto diet for this for two reasons. First, I had just returned from a trip to Universal Studios where I probably walked more in a single day than I did for the whole year. Second, I wasn’t tracking what I ate very well. We all suspect that too much protein may have at least played a part. Unfortunately the keto diet is NOT high fat, high carb, high protein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;span-style-text-decoration-underline-span-style-font-weight-400-this-year-i-plan-to-do-the-following-for-my-health-span-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This year I plan to do the following for my health:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Continue the Keto Diet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Track what I eat daily&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Weight training every weekday&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-family-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-vacation-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Vacation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For the last few years I have made an effort to take the family somewhere where we can have a good time and relax. I would prefer to go places where I can experience a different culture. I’m not a big fan of tourist attractions, especially amusement parks. We did go to Universal Studio this year as part of a company get together. It was fun but I ended up walking more than I should have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we are planning on taking at least two trips, one as a family and the other with just Linda and I. The company I work for is headquartered near Ft Lauderdale, Florida. Our plan is to stay there for about a month after the boys get out of school. I will be working but we should have plenty of time to see things after hours, especially the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linda has an Aunt that lives in France. She has been after us to come visit for years. We keep saying that we will but due to one thing or another, we’ve never done it. This year we plan to change that. We hope to travel to Europe for a few weeks and visit Paris while we are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-children-goal-evaluations-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Children Goal Evaluations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Setting goals and plans for my future is great but it isn’t enough. I have two boys to think about as well. When it comes to them, it’s easy to focus only on finances and saving for college etc, but I think it is also important to teach them to set their own goals and plans. With that in mind, I spent a few hours with them, mainly the oldest, talking about goals and plans. We set goals for the year and listed a few things to try to do this month to hit those goals and plans. My plan is to sit down with them once a month to see how things are going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;span-style-text-decoration-underline-span-style-font-weight-400-this-year-i-plan-to-do-the-following-for-my-family-span-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This year I plan to do the following for my family:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Spend a month in Florida&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Take Linda to France&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Have monthly goal evaluations with the boys&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-professional-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Professional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-writing-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I don’t typically write about topics that have mass appeal. I don’t spend a lot of time marketing or doing any of the things that it takes to gain a large group of readers. However, every once in awhile I write something that attracts more visits than I am used to. It is hard not to get discouraged when that kind of web traffic isn’t consistent. When I get discouraged, I tend to stop writing. I have to remind myself of the reasons I write here in the first place. I want to be a better writer and I want to record my thoughts for one future reader, myself. The main reason I publish these posts is to be held accountable to any potential readers, who, in my mind, call my bluff every time I write a single line of bullshit. I lost sight of that for the better part of two years. This year, I intend to write at least 300 words every day. Most of it will probably end up on this blog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-coding-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Coding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The technology that I use to do my job as a software developer is in constant flux. It seems like every other day there is a new programming language or javascript framework that I need to learn. In the last 6 months at work, I have written code involving the following technologies:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;C#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Sql Server&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;KnockoutJs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Jasmine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Specflow&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Nunit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;NodeJs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;AngularJs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Mocha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Karma&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;SinonJs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;GoLang&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;MongoDb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, the only ones that I had used in the past for production quality code was C#, Sql Server and Nunit. However, I had used several of them for code that I wrote at home for fun. If I waited to learn a technology when I needed it for work, I would be lost most of the time and probably out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to learn new technologies, I need projects to implement them with. I have a ton of different ideas for projects, but, as I have pointed out, I tend to start them and never finish. This year I am going to work on a specific largish project that I can create using emerging technology. That project will be an event management web application which I will write more about later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-family-business-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Family Business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;We have decided for various reasons that we want to start a family business. The primary purpose of this business is to give both Linda and Drew a way of gaining practical experience. My job provides enough money to support us and it offers us great benefits like health insurance, life insurance and a retirement plan. However, if anything happened to me it would be difficult for Linda to continue our current standard of living. Also Drew intends to go to college when he graduates from high school, but the job market is competitive. Having practical work experience will give him an advantage. We have a few ideas of different businesses we might start, but we want to make sure it is a good fit for all of us. It needs to be something that we all can play a big part in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;span-style-text-decoration-underline-span-style-font-weight-400-this-year-i-plan-to-do-the-following-professionally-span-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This year I plan to do the following professionally:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Write at least 300 words a day&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Create an event planning application&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Start a family business&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-personal-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I have a few different hobbies that help me avoid getting burned out. I have been playing the guitar since I was a boy and I like to play a video game every once in awhile. I think this has been good for me and I don’t plan to change anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This biggest problem that I have personally is that I don’t spend a lot of time cultivating friendships. I have two good friends that I visit every once in awhile. We have made a few acquaintances since we have moved to Mustang, but no one that, for example, we would invite over to dinner. We plan to stay here for quite awhile so it makes sense for us to work on this. A friend or two with something in common with us would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I want to improve is my fluency in Spanish. I do speak Spanish a bit but I could definitely be better. Linda and I have talked about taking a class but I am not ready to commit to that this year. In the meantime, I will continue to have small conversations in Spanish with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;span-style-text-decoration-underline-span-style-font-weight-400-this-year-i-plan-to-do-the-following-personally-span-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This year I plan to do the following personally:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Work on my social life&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Improve my Spanish &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;span-style-font-weight-400-financial-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Financial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The older I get, the more I realize that money is something that I may need after a time when I’m no longer able to earn it at my current rate. This leads to all sorts of other realizations. Saving money has become more of a priority. It also means that I probably should only spend as necessary. It turns out that isn’t so easy. It is hard to know what you need when that decision is made in real time. We have not done a very good job of managing our money. So one of our biggest priorities this year is creating a budget. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to figure out more precisely what we spend our money on.  To accomplish this we need to categorize the way in which we currently spend. I suspect that once we figure out how much we spend on fast food and entertainment that we will be astonished. Once we understand our spending better, then we can create a budget. This will help us manage our money better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a good budget will make it easier to save money for retirement, but it will help in other ways as well. An issue we run into is having the funds to take care of unexpected expenses. These usually come in the form of home repairs, trouble with vehicles or sickness of some sort. It would also help to pay for not so unexpected expenses like replacing old appliances, furniture or vehicles. What we really need is some sort of maintenance plan. If we replaced expensive items on a regular basis then we may not ever need to repair something that we should have replaced but couldn’t afford to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;span-style-text-decoration-underline-span-style-font-weight-400-this-year-i-plan-to-do-the-following-for-my-finances-span-span&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This year I plan to do the following for my finances:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Create and follow a budget&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Create and follow a maintenance plan&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In the past when I have set goals and plans, I tried to challenge myself. I would essentially set myself up for failure. I have not done that this year. I should be able to accomplish these goals easily as long as I stay focused. I recognize that life tends to happen in unexpected ways. I also am aware of my own tendency to get bored with something and move on to something else. With this in mind, I have devised a procedure for allowing change to these goals. I will write about it in more detail later but essentially, I am only allowed to modify these goals once a quarter. Also, if I do modify a goal I must explain myself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about the upcoming year. I am hopeful that we can avoid some of the bad stuff that happened in 2015. I feel like I have a clear idea of what I want to do in the next year. Now I just need to get busy doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;year-in-review-summary&#34;&gt;Year in Review summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In an effort to improve my life, I am publishing a year in review for 2015. Since I didn’t set any goals last year, it is a bit hard to grade my progress. So, before the year is over, I intend to set a few goals on what I want to improve next year. But first, I think it would help to summarize how i think things went in 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year has been one of the strangest of my life. I had a few bad months that were some of the most difficult of my life. We dealt with some medical issues that nearly ruined everything. But I was also able to find the perfect job and in the end, both Linda and I are in the best shape of our adult lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time last year, we were still making the transition from [living in Texas][1] to living in Oklahoma. I was starting to realize that my job at Integris was less than ideal.  Linda was dealing with some lingering pain from a minor surgery in mid 2014. Drew was making good grades but still trying to find his place at school. Of us all, Ethan seemed to have the easiest time. He was playing basketball and getting glowing reviews from his teachers at school. All of those issues have now been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a review of my year, I won’t mention the triumphs or struggles of Linda and the boys much. I’ll start with what didn’t go so well this year. Since I firmly believe that you can only improve on your own shortcoming, I will not dwell on the shortcoming of the people I came into contact with this year. The following is a list of my biggest mistakes of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;integris-job&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integris Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The biggest mistake I made last year was staying at Integris too long. It was painfully obvious from the beginning that the job was not for me. I stayed as long as I did so that we could finish the process of buying a house. We were paying way too much in rent. What we originally planned to do was to buy a house on about 5 acres of land. We never found the right place. The process was taking too long and every moment we waited was more time I had to stay at Integris. We eventually bought a house in town. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted to do was start my own business. It is very difficult to get a home loan when you are self employed, especially in the beginning. So I had to stick it out at Integris until the loan closed. The truth is that I wasn’t really prepared to start my own business. I had a few prospects and a good idea but it was too big of a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have at least spent more time polishing my resume, making contacts and looking for  opportunities. Instead I let a bad situation fester until there was no choice but to leave then and there. This happened in the middle of June about a month after our loan closed. In the end, we bought a great house and I opted to take a job instead of starting my own business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethan-playing-football&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethan Playing Football&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/11/18/the-purpose-of-being-a-parent/&#34;&gt;As I have mentioned before, every child is different&lt;/a&gt;. Ethan and Drew are like night and day. Playing football at an early age had a great impact on Drew. It didn’t work out that way for Ethan. In hindsight, I don’t think we should have ever signed him up to play. Before the deadline, we asked him several times if he wanted to play. He was noncommittal. Finally on the last day, we demanded an answer and he agreed to play. We signed him up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There were two teams in our town and by that point both were nearly out of spots. The other boys on the team had already been practicing for a month when we joined. So right from the beginning Ethan was playing catch up.  It took a lot of work to just get him out on the field for practice. He would stand there and make up excuses for why he couldn’t go. He claimed that he was sick, nervous, or that his head hurt. So, I would walk him out there. It took awhile but eventually he would do fine. Except that this happened before every practice and every game. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Eventually his coaches gave up on him and didn’t involve him in much except for warm ups and individual drills. When it came time to practice on the actual plays, he mostly sat out. He also sat out for all but the last minute or so of games. It’s hard to blame the coaches too much for this. He didn’t want to play and they were up front that they wanted to have a competitive team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;After a lot of thought, I came to realize that Ethan might suffer a bit from social anxiety. Getting sick to his stomach and refusing to play despite some pretty serious threats of grounding should have been an indication. I have since talked to several people who suffer from social anxiety and each describe the same symptoms. Each confessed that their childhoods were painful. Most of them felt like their parents could have handled it better. We eventually decided to pull him off of the team and work on this problem in a different way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;over-extending-myself&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over Extending Myself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I am by nature a curious guy. I have dozens of things that I am more than passively interested in. I tend to switch from one project to another without ever actually finishing anything. Below are a list of the projects that I started but ultimately abandoned last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;An Event Planning System&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A Live performance search engine for local bands&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Bitcoin payments for link sharing project&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;An online local newspaper&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A security audit tracking system&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A productivity blog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This blog for most of the year&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A band consisting entirely of family musicians&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;An album of original music&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Half a dozen original songs, left half recorded&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;At least two complete songs that I never shared&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A website dedicated to family news&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Almost certainly more that I don’t remember.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;None of these projects are bad ideas or unworthy of my time. In fact, the problem is the exact opposite. Starting a project is fun but finishing it is hard. It takes dedication and a plan to finish a project. When you start them all willy nilly, they tend to end the same way. As soon as something more fun comes around, you jump ship. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;That all stops next year. I have devised a system that will hold me accountable to finish what I start. However, I do recognize that sometimes it is necessary to abandon a project. The reason should not be that I read a book which gave me an idea for something new. I plan to write about my system in a different post. It helps me focus but leaves room for change during certain times of the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;These are only some of the issues I ran into this last year. There were definitely more that are less important to me. Linda asked me why I wanted to publish this information. She is a bit more private than me. My answer is the same as the reason I publish anything on this website, I want to improve. I want to be better prepared. I want to be a better writer. I want to be better at everything I do.  I feel that I will do better if I am held accountable. I know of no better way of being held accountable than to tell everyone my intentions or what I’m thinking. It is hard to lie to yourself when the truth is written in black and white.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;in the next portion of my year in review for 2015, I will write about what I want to do next year. I will explain the process of how I decide what to do and how I plan to keep myself on task. Hopefully, during my next year in review, I will have more to work with than I do now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Purpose of being a Parent</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/11/18/the-purpose-of-being-a-parent/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/11/18/the-purpose-of-being-a-parent/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was seventeen my father confessed, “Hey, I’ve never done this before. We are practicing on you.”. I think every parent on earth feels that way. We really have no idea what we are doing. Most of us are dealing with issues as they come by the seat of our pants. Even worse, the rules keep changing. And it doesn’t really matter how much experience or how many kids you have. The biggest mistake a parent can make is to expect what worked with one child to work on another. Being a parent is just hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up is the process of gradually taking more responsibility of your life. A child’s job is to fight for control of their lives until eventually they pull away. It’s like a game of tug of war with the kid at one end and the parent at the other. Whoever has more rope has more control but It’s a big rope. If, as a parent, you let go too soon your kid will fall backwards on their ass. That doesn’t stop most of them from trying. Too much control too soon is overwhelming. But parents can’t hold on forever. No one just magically becomes an adult at eighteen. The parent should give in slowly until eventually they feel comfortable letting go completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids rarely figure this out until they are grown. It has been difficult to explain to my oldest why I do what I do. I talk to him about the future. I try to make him understand that what he does now has a big effect on what he can expect later. To him the future happens in the next month or so. He still mostly lives his life as it happens. I am the roadblock that he has to get around. He knows that if he gets all A’s in school then he can play video games during the week. He knows that if he doesn’t do his chores that I am likely to get upset and punish him. He is starting to understand that he can get what he wants by giving me what I want. For my part, I try to only get in the way enough so that it is hard for him to do anything especially stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My youngest, on the other hand, lives a lot of his life in the clouds. He creates fantasy worlds in his head that he uses to test out situations that either scare or excite him. He is a bit more cautious and usually prefers to be alone. I encourage him to become the hero of those fantasy worlds. I try to teach him to be brave. We make an effort to get him involved in group activities so that he can get comfortable being around other kids. My wife and I have learned that we have to be careful about how hard we push him. Too much pressure and he shuts down. He retreats into of his imagination and we have to work hard to get him back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of being a parent is to teach children how to be adults. That responsibility trumps everything else while they are growing up.  Every kid is different. What works for one probably won’t work for another. One may try to jerk that rope out of your hands at every turn. Another may be content to let you lead them around forever. Either way can lead to trouble. Eventually our children must grow up to be adults that are capable of caring for themselves and their families. Hell, we may eventually need them to take care of us too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind?</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/10/23/does-fort-worth-ever-cross-your-mind/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/10/23/does-fort-worth-ever-cross-your-mind/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;As I fly over DFW airport, I can see downtown Fort Worth in the distance. I have 13 years worth of memories there that are surprisingly happy considering how eager I was to leave. I guess it is hard to fully appreciate something while you are experiencing it. The tendency, at least for me, is to move forward. I have been in pursuit of some ambitious goal ever since I was a boy. It is virtually impossible to look back while you are going full steam ahead. But the older I get the more I find myself reminiscing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I think that ambition is one of the things that separate the young from the old. Young men have a drive to succeed, usually out of necessity, that their elders can’t match. Sorry ladies but I only feel qualified to stereotype men, so don’t be offended if I leave you out. As a young man, I would try to brute force life until it either worked out for me or broke. I either got the knowledge, the job, the girl or there was a restraining order.  Thankfully I’ve matured a little bit over the years. I learned to rely less on bravado and more on experience and intelligence. Ironically most of that experience wouldn’t have been possible without youthful bravado.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Sometimes it feels like tradition herds us into a common routine of school, job, marriage, kids, retirement etc. I can remember feeling trapped as if my life had been planned without my input or consent. Now I realize that it takes a certain amount of order for freedom to even be possible. If you bulldoze your way into getting the things you want, you end up breaking them. It took getting married and having a family before I could even begin to comprehend this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;We moved to Fort Worth in 2001. I wanted a job as a software developer. There wasn’t much of a market for that sort of thing in Oklahoma City at the time. Truth be known, I just needed a change of scenery and Fort Worth was as far as Linda would go. We did all of the things that grown ups are supposed to do. I began a career, we had kids and bought a house. We also made every mistake in the book. In short, we both grew up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;My focus has shifted. Instead of trying to find my place in society, I now think a lot more about putting my boys in the best situation so that they can find theirs.  I no longer feel the need to conquer the world the way I did when I was 25. I enjoy spending time with my wife. We like to watch our boys play sports. I am quite happy with my job. My primary goal now is to be the best father I can be, which does seem ambitious at times. I learned a lot in Fort Worth. We stayed there a lot longer than we ever intended. However, I don’t regret it and I miss all of the close friends I made. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;My plane is now flying directly over Jerry World. I am reminded of a 4th of July that we spent watching a fireworks show in an empty parking lot across the street. There was another family there who understood English about as much as we understood Spanish. Our intention had been to find a park. Instead, we spent the night sitting in the back of my truck watching the show with new friends. We never saw that family again and we always prepared for our 4th of July outings better after that. But as I look back, I remember that night fondly. I feel the same about Fort Worth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Teach Kids to Learn</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/04/26/how-to-teach-kids-to-learn/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2015/04/26/how-to-teach-kids-to-learn/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Kids naturally learn. It’s what they do. In the dictionary it should describe children as “Small humans who obtain knowledge at dizzying speeds with the express intent of driving their parents insane”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As parents, our concern is what they are learning from whom. Our hope is that they are being influenced by parents, teachers, and coaches etc. The truth is that they are primarily influenced by video games, YouTube videos and their friends, mostly their friends. It is possibly even better that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want them to learn skills that will be useful to them as they grow older. Reading, writing and arithmetic come to mind. The ability to use a computer and communicate clearly are invaluable skills as well. But it is hard to tell if they are learning anything. So, we turn to tests which suck the fun right out of everything. A test converts the tendency to learn into something to be avoided. Learning has become a dirty word that conjures up visions of being bored half to death while old people talk endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, testing is very hard to accomplish. How does one know that a kid has learned what they need to know? Our answer has been to standardize what we teach them. There has to be a definite right answer to determine wrong answers. It also allows us to gauge their progress against the progress of other students. Nevermind that different people have different talents. Nevermind that we NEED different people to have different skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School has become this place where we send our kids to learn how to memorize facts and follow instructions. Most of them take it to heart and spend their lives looking to be told what to do next. Some of them rebel and look for every opportunity to give the middle finger to authority often at their own expense. A small few learn to lead the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do some kids lead while others follow? Where do the leaders find the courage to do their own thing? The answer is confidence or even arrogance. At some point the kid took a chance and it paid off. This almost always meant that he learned to fail the right way. Or that she learned to treat a mistake like a setback instead of an excuse to quit. The trick was to find something they wanted so badly that they were willing to risk failure to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-should-we-do&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what should we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning is easy when it is needed for something awesome. Sometimes it just takes a little push. At our house, we are trying out an experiment. The idea is to always have some kind of creative project in the works. We define creative as something that the project owner considers art. We give each other daily updates as is possible. The updates consist of what you’ve done and what you intend to do next. It’s as simple as that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no size, type or time limits, as long as you are actively participating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No physical help. Questions are fine but the project should be completed alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can not buy the end result of your project. You can however buy ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to buy a resource / ingredient, you must use your own money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s Next Updates should have a tangible result. No saying, I’m going to think about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you haven’t made any progress within a week, it means your project wasn’t exciting  enough. You should choose something new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a project is finished or abandoned, a new one must take it’s place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must love and care about your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create an environment that encourages taking on risk. It is my hope that we learn that the more you put into something the more satisfaction you get from it’s completion. I hope we learn that failure is a necessary part of learning. I also hope that we learn to take pride in our work. Taking on bigger and more elaborate projects over time is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids do not spontaneously lose interest in learning. We train them to avoid it by trying to force them to prove how much they’ve learned. If we want to teach kids to learn we must encourage them to create art that they love. It will give them the courage they need to lead instead of abstain or follow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Get Things Done – GTD</title>
      <link>http://erikvancraddock.com/2013/08/25/how-to-get-things-done/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2013/07/29/an-overview-of-getting-things-done-lists/&#34;&gt;Lists are how we track what we need to do&lt;/a&gt; but this alone is not enough. Despite an abundance of technology available to help us keep track of tasks, many of us still keep these lists in our heads. We do this for a variety of reasons. They all have a common root. We don’t trust our system. We don’t actually believe that the list is the full list. We know that things have either been forgotten to be put on the list or were not important enough to track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we can’t trust our system, we do what comes natural. We attempt to remember. We deal with issues as they come. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. That is until there is another louder squeak. This inevitably leads to stress and poor performance. The true genius of GTD are the procedures that help us manage lists. The integrity of our lists are what make the system trustworthy. To achieve this GTD is broken up into five different categories, Collect, Process, Organize, Review and Do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Collect
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  It is essential that every thought, idea, request or demand that you have or receive be collected in a place that can be reviewed later. It is not necessary that you act on these items immediately but don’t be in a situation where you are forced to remember them. Always have a notepad and pen, a mobile computer or a voice recorder with you at all times. If you fail to collect tasks as they come you will lose faith in your system. If you are relying on your memory anyway, you will stop bothering with the system.  All of your tasks and notes should be deposited into a central Inbox so that you can process them at a later time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Process
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Most of us have way more to do than we could ever keep track of in our brains. It doesn’t really help to have a huge lists of tasks stored elsewhere either. At some point we need to organize the tasks into sections so that they are easier to manage. Traditionally this is done only when we are at our wits end. We throw up our hands and say “I’ve got to get organized.” We then stack the papers that are strewn about into neat piles and throw away anything not immediately identifiable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GTD this is a daily process. The instinct is to leave anything that we’re not ready to deal with in the inbox whether its an email or a physical piece of paper. Before you know it your inbox is unmanageable and the scenario above is triggered. With GTD this is how tasks get into our lists. Each task begins its life in the inbox. At least once a day, the inbox is emptied by either transferring its contents to a list, the trash or to be archived as reference material.  We accomplish this one task at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each task in the inbox item is put through a series of questions. It is very important to process one item at a time. An item should never be returned to the inbox. Don’t pick and choose which ones to process. Take them as they come. Processing starts with a question. Is the item actionable? Can something be done about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  No
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  If the answer is no, then there is one of three choices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    If it is trash, throw it away.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    If the required action can not be taken until some time in the future, then add it to your calendar.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    Some things are purely valuable as information. This information might be handy in the future but there is no immediate action that needs to be taken. We file these away in a bookmark, reference folder or archive the email.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Yes
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  If there is action to be taken, then determine if it is a single task or a project. Add projects to your projects lists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to determine the next action. What is the next thing to do to further or finish the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the next action will take less than 2 minutes then just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it needs to be added to a list. Are you the best person to perform this task? If so add the task to your Next Actions list. Otherwise, delegate the task to the person that is. Add the task to your waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Organize
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Keeping everything in its proper place establishes an order that gives us faith in the system. Lists are the proper places for a task. New unprocessed items belong in the Inbox. The name to identify multistep tasks are stored in the Project list. Tasks that are ready to be worked on are stored in the Next Actions list. Unfinished tasks that have been delegated are kept in the Waiting list. Projects or tasks that you may want to do in the future are stored in the Maybe / Someday list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tasks don’t neatly fit into any of these lists. Some tasks can not be accomplished until some other condition is met first. It might be that a project can not be started until some other project is completed. On the other hand some tasks can not begin until a certain date or time. For these types of projects we have two different tools to ensure that when the time comes we are ready. These tools are the tickler file and the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tickler file is essentially a reminder to deal with a task. You will be reminded of this task either during your weekly review or by checking your calendar. Here is an example. If you are a musician and you might think of a clever new trick you want to use in your next video. Since you are currently focusing on recording the song, it is not the appropriate time to act on it. You are not exactly sure when you will begin working on the video. The answer is to make a note of the idea and add it to the tickler file for the music video project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method of ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks is your calendar. Anything that needs to be done on a specific date or at a specific time should be entered onto your calendar. It is recommend to use an online calendar with a good reminder system. Some tasks can not be completed until a certain date. For example, the tickets for the concert that you want to attend may not go on sale until a date in the future. Add a reminder to your calendar to purchase tickets on the correct date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Review
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  One of the most import aspects of the GTD system is also the most overlooked. Spending the time to refresh your memory on everything you have is the best way to ensure that none of it slips between the cracks. A review of everything in your system should be accomplished at least once a week. Some things will never be addressed until you have a review. Your tickler file and Maybe / Someday lists in particular are dependant on the review process. If you fail to review your system at least once a week, you will find that you stop using the parts of the system which require it. Your weekly review should consist of five different tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Review the Next Action List
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Look over each task. How long has the task been in the Next Actions List? Do you actually intend to do it? Be honest. Sometimes we have good intentions but when push comes to shove, it just isn’t going to happen. If you are not going to do it, then trash it. Things change. Has something happened since you added the task to your next actions list that prevents or discourages you from doing this work. Maybe now is no longer the right time. If you intend to work on the project but not right now, move it to the Maybe / Someday list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common reason for a task lingering on the Next Actions List is confusion over what the task actually is. Typically this happens when your task is actually a project. Ask yourself what the next action actually is and update the task accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Review the Project List
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  The review process is the time to evaluate the status of each of your projects. How many tasks are left to be completed? How far along in the process are you? It is not until after the review process that you can be confident that a project is completed. As with the Next Action List review, this is the time to ask yourself the hard questions. If no progress has been made on a project since your last review, it may be time to either trash it or move it to the Maybe / Someday list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Review the Maybe / Someday List
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Of all of our lists, the Maybe / Someday list is the most dependant on the review process. This is where we store the ideas that we don’t want to forget about. Many of the projects that we are working on now will have some kind of impact on our future projects. While reading our Someday list, it may become obvious that a current project could be tweaked to include a listed idea. Update your project list or next actions as necessary and remove it from the Maybe / Someday list.  It is also possible that one of our current projects may nullify the need of a listed project. In this case remove it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have ideas that seem brilliant as we are having them. We may decide to put them on the back burner. Later on, we wonder what in the world we were thinking. We no longer have any interest in the project. These should obviously be deleted. On the other hand, when one project is completed it is time to begin another. Our Maybe / Someday list is the obvious place to look for more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another benefit to the review process. During this period, you will almost surely have new ideas. One project will remind you of another project that you want to undertake at some point. Occasionally, an idea from one project combines with an idea from another. When this happens a new idea is born, one that you may have never thought of otherwise. Although, you must be careful not to let your list get too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer your list of ideas, the less likely you will be to review them. When a project has spent too long in your Maybe / Someday list, it could be time to remove it. This is obviously a judgement call. At a certain point you need to be honest with yourself. If five years have gone by and you still haven’t planted that garden in the backyard, you might need to consider that you may never do it. The finality of removing an idea from your Maybe / Someday list can be hard. It will clear up time and effort for projects that you will actually work on. This is true even if it is only during the review cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Review the Waiting List
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Almost certainly at some point, you will find yourself waiting for someone to finish a task before you can move on or complete a project. You may have a varying amount of influence over that person. You may have direct authority over some people. You may be able to directly set their priorities. You may have no authority at all over others. Your options will range from a kind word of encouragement all the way to dropping the project. At the very least, you’re waiting list is a good place to keep yourself reminded of who is holding up progress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Calendar / Tickler File
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  You’re calendar and tickler files are like your own personal crystal ball. You can get a pretty good idea of what your future holds by looking at what you have planned. The amount of progress that  you’ve made since your last review will help you determine what you can expect. It may be necessary to change an appointment or modify a deadline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tickler file is essentially a reminder with no specific date, time or task association. Without the review process a tickler file is useless. It might make sense to check the tickler file every day to keep this information as a constant reminder. The tickler file must be checked at least once a week to retain its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;what-8217-s-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Next&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparation is a waste of time unless it is followed by the actual work. In a future article I will write about [using goals][1]. I will also offer some tips on actually doing the tasks that have been planned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Overview of Getting Things Done – Lists</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Getting Things Done is a task management system created by David Allen. Its purpose is to establish a framework for tracking tasks so that all necessary resources are available when and where they are needed. A primary focus is to ensure that the system can be trusted as the one source of anything that needs to be done. This is an overview of the system from my own point of view. This overview is derived from the knowledge I gained from reading the book and implementing it in my life. I highly recommend that you purchase and read the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/B007J5D4QQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1471890232&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=getting+things+done&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity&lt;/a&gt;. It is the definitive source for the processes and procedures of Mr. Allen’s system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gettings Things Done is typically referred to by its acronym, GTD. It is not a software application, nor is it contained in a physical binder or notebook. It isn’t even a product for sale. It is philosophy with a set of recommended procedures for simplifying the process of implementing a trusted project management system. Many companies and individuals have created tools to accommodate the GTD System. They come in the form of software or paper products designed to help implement the system. But all that is truly needed is paper, a writing utensil, a calendar and a method of binding multiple pieces of paper together such as a paper clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Lists
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  At its core GTD is a collection of lists. There are four types; Projects, Next Actions, Waiting and Maybe/Someday lists. A list might be comprised of lines written on a piece of paper or full pages bound together. For example your waiting list might either have five items you’re waiting on or five pages with an individual item on each page. Each list has a specific purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Project:
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  A project is the name given to a list of associated tasks. To qualify as a project the list of tasks when completed should result in a related outcome. If any desired outcome requires that more than one action is taken, it is considered a project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Similar tasks in certain situations could be considered a task or a project. For example “Email Cable company tech support” might be a project with multiple tasks such as; “search for company website” and “find email address on company website”. On the other hand if the other information is on hand the task might be “Email phone company technical support at email@company.com”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Next Action:
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  A next action is a single task that is the next thing that needs to be done to bring a project one step closer to completion. A next action should be clear and concise. If a task hangs around in your next actions list for too long, it’s probably because it is not actually the next action. If you are not quite sure how to do your next action, there is probably another step you are not listing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Not correctly identifying the next action is where projects typically get stuck. If your next action is “Fix the bicycle”, it would not be surprising to feel a certain amount of hesitation at performing this task. The reason is that it is difficult to determine the details. How long will it take? What tools do I need? Do I even have the tools? This is of course because “fix the bike” is not actually the next action. A better next action might be “determine what is wrong with the bike”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Waiting
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Some projects require work or input from other people, who don’t always respond immediately. It is very easy to lose track of a project while it is sitting in someone else’s inbox. That is why we have the waiting list. Keeping a task in a waiting folder accomplishes two things. It keeps a relic of the project in a place where we won’t forget about it. It quickly gives us the status of the project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It is not always people that we wait on. Sometimes a task is better left undone until a specific date. Maybe you have written an application that targets the next version of Microsoft Windows that is soon to be released. You would want to wait for Microsoft to release before releasing your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Maybe / Someday
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  It is important to stay focused. You will never accomplish anything if you begin a large new project every day. At the same time, you don’t want to disregard an idea simply because you don’t have time for it at the moment. These types of projects should be kept in a maybe list. But be careful. You do not want to let your someday list get too big. If you are not able or inclined to review it then the list might as well not exist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maybe list is also valuable for keeping track of things that you aren’t ready for yet. For example you might keep a list of books you want to read. Or you might keep a list of gift ideas.  Song titles, a storyline, partial poem lyrics, a business strategy, a marketing angle,  this is the place to store all of your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;Whats Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a logical way of storing the things we want to do in a list is not enough. Next I&amp;#8217;ll &lt;a href=&#34;http://erikvancraddock.com/2013/08/25/how-to-get-things-done/&#34;&gt;describe the processes&lt;/a&gt; that are necessary to get the work done.&lt;/p&gt;
