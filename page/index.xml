      <description>I love to read. I read so much that sometimes I worry about how healthy it might be. When I am in need of a good book I ask my friends. So it is only fair that I also recommend the books that I enjoy.

      <description>I am a musician, writer and software developer not necessarily in that order depending on the day. This website serves as a sort of haphazard living autobiography.
I would like to state that it is written for an audience of one, me, but that would be a lie. I suffer just enough from megalomania to believe that others might be interested in my ramblings.
Practically speaking this website is a platform for documenting my ever evolving interests, ideas and life experiences.</description>
