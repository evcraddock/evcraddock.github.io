      <description>Move Drive files from Google apps to gmail.com account Drive Migrating your Google Drive files is the least automated process of them all. What I mean by that is that there is not a way to migrate your files. Instead, it is necessary to download your files from your existing account. Then, you need to upload those file to your new gmail.com account Drive. There is one hangup. Google documents are not actually documents.</description>

      <title>GSuite Migration Part 3 - Import Contacts</title>

      <description>Import Google Suite contacts into your gmail.com account The email import tool claims to also import your contacts. That does not seem to be the case in my experience. Thankfully, exporting and importing contacts is pretty simple. However, having duplicate contacts is annoying. You should probably verify that your contacts have already been imported. Otherwise here is how you do it.
 Go to the contacts website and log in as your Google Suite/Apps account Click on the Export link in the sidebar and then select Google CSV and click the Export button It will prompt you with how to handle the file.</description>

      <description>Import Google Suite email into your gmail.com account If you are worried about changing your email address, don&amp;rsquo;t be. I know that a lot of you have had your google apps email address for awhile. You have given it out to a lot of people. You want to continue to use it. You will still be able to use your email address.
What we are going to do is forward your email address from your google app email to your new gmail.</description>

      <description>Many years ago I setup my personal domain using Google Apps. Over the years, I gave friends and family accounts on my personal domain. When I first set this up it was free. It no longer is and I have decided to move my domain off of Google Suite as it is now called. Switching isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as you would hope. There are several things to consider.
 Third party applications that use Google Authentication Email Contacts Calendar Google Drive  As I mentioned, family and friends are also using this domain.</description>

      <title>How to find good ideas</title>

      <description>For several years, I wrote articles for this blog regularly. I never had a particular subject that I focused on. I never considered writing as something serious. I just wanted to be a better writer, and the best way to learn to write is to write.
What I actually learned is that I enjoy writing and dread it at the same time. I always got stuck on what to write. What do I have to say that is worth reading?</description>

      <title>A Gluttonous Amount of Music</title>

      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2019/01/gluttony-music/</guid>
      <description>Music has become so ubiquitous that it has mostly lost it&amp;rsquo;s luster. Gone are the days when your music collection defined you as a person. Gone are the days when listening to music was an actual past time. Music is now a commodity. It is the noise that acts as the sound track for our lives. This is hardly even debatable at this point. I know that there are still insurgent music listeners out there, little pockets of resistance who probably sit around their record players soaking in the ambiance.</description>

      <description>When my son was about five years old, he asked me to play one of his games for him. He was stuck on a difficult level that he couldn’t beat. I wouldn’t help. I refused to play the game for him. I pointed out that if I beat the level than, I would be having the fun, not him. He decided not to play that game anymore. He said it wasn’t fun unless he was winning.</description>

      <description>For the past few months, I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like writing. I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like working on anything really. It has been impossible to motivate myself. The [resistence] (https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/) has kicked my ass. I&amp;rsquo;ve been burned out. I actually started writing this post in July and put it down until now. Why did I allow this to happen? There are several reasons, none of them good.
What causes burnout? [Burnout] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout) is a form of depression caused by stress due to work.</description>

      <title>How I consume the Internet</title>

      <description>I am an information junkie. I go from one obsession to the next. The Internet deals me out a constant supply of articles, images, music and video on any and every subject I can imagine. It is very easy to get sucked in. If I&amp;rsquo;m not careful I will find myself reading about some obscure religious rite or the mating habits of deep sea creatures or Neuromancer fan fiction. Every subject is represented.</description>

      <title>Don’t automate your life</title>

      <guid>http://erikvancraddock.com/2016/05/dont-automate-life/</guid>
      <description>TLDR; Don’t automate your life. Technology has evolved to the point to where it is almost possible to do just that. We rely on computers to think for us too much. It is causing our minds to atrophy. Spend your time learning and contributing to the world instead of constantly entertaining yourself.
Remembering Phone Numbers When I was a teenager, I could remember a telephone number like my wife now remembers my every mistake.</description>

      <title>Meet Good People Online</title>

      <description>I think that it’s possible to meet good people online without feeling like a creep and with very little risk. I think that the key to making friends online is by spending time with them offline. Conventional knowledge tells us that meeting people in person that we met on the Internet is a bad idea and potentially dangerous. I believe that I know how to solve that problem. Below are my ideas for using the Internet to safely meet people who are worth friendship.</description>

      <description>Did Facebook do us a favor? It’s been said that social media websites, like Facebook, are ruining social interactions. I have always been of the opinion that these websites make it easy to know enough about your friends so that you never need to speak to them again. Usually, when I see a friend we discuss what happened since we saw each other last. That is hardly necessary when you are kept informed in real time of their day to day experiences.</description>

      <description>Much of the time, we set ourselves up for failure. We set goals in order to please someone else. We plan for things that we aren’t ready to tackle. We try to do too much. These are recipes for failure. If you are going to set goals, make sure that they are achievable. Spend some time figuring out what you need to do. Determine what success looks like and make plans.</description>

      <description>Every year in January a horde of people line up at the gym for that magical workout that will change their lives forever. They make grandiose promises of losing 50 pounds, giving up sugar, or quitting smoking. Of course by the 2nd week of January the gym is a ghost town, candy bar sales are through the roof and that pack of cigarettes became two. Why is it so hard to do what we know needs to be done?</description>

      <description>When it came time to review how things went in 2015, I had a hard time. I had nothing to work with because I did not set any goals and plans at the beginning of the year. The only valuable thing I was able to do was list out the areas where I did not do so well. This year will be different. I have set a number of goals and plans for myself.</description>

      <description>Year in Review summary In an effort to improve my life, I am publishing a year in review for 2015. Since I didn’t set any goals last year, it is a bit hard to grade my progress. So, before the year is over, I intend to set a few goals on what I want to improve next year. But first, I think it would help to summarize how i think things went in 2015.</description>

      <title>The Purpose of being a Parent</title>

      <description>When I was seventeen my father confessed, “Hey, I’ve never done this before. We are practicing on you.”. I think every parent on earth feels that way. We really have no idea what we are doing. Most of us are dealing with issues as they come by the seat of our pants. Even worse, the rules keep changing. And it doesn’t really matter how much experience or how many kids you have.</description>

      <description>As I fly over DFW airport, I can see downtown Fort Worth in the distance. I have 13 years worth of memories there that are surprisingly happy considering how eager I was to leave. I guess it is hard to fully appreciate something while you are experiencing it. The tendency, at least for me, is to move forward. I have been in pursuit of some ambitious goal ever since I was a boy.</description>

      <title>How to Teach Kids to Learn</title>

      <description>Kids naturally learn. It’s what they do. In the dictionary it should describe children as “Small humans who obtain knowledge at dizzying speeds with the express intent of driving their parents insane”.
As parents, our concern is what they are learning from whom. Our hope is that they are being influenced by parents, teachers, and coaches etc. The truth is that they are primarily influenced by video games, YouTube videos and their friends, mostly their friends.</description>

      <description>[Lists are how we track what we need to do] (/2013/07/29/an-overview-of-getting-things-done-lists/) but this alone is not enough. Despite an abundance of technology available to help us keep track of tasks, many of us still keep these lists in our heads. We do this for a variety of reasons. They all have a common root. We don’t trust our system. We don’t actually believe that the list is the full list. We know that things have either been forgotten to be put on the list or were not important enough to track.</description>

      <description>Getting Things Done is a task management system created by David Allen. Its purpose is to establish a framework for tracking tasks so that all necessary resources are available when and where they are needed. A primary focus is to ensure that the system can be trusted as the one source of anything that needs to be done. This is an overview of the system from my own point of view.</description>

      <description>Have you ever known someone so well that you could complete their sentences? With some people there is hardly a need for verbal communication at all. Half the time, my wife knows what I’m feeling better than I do based solely on my posture and facial expressions. Our biggest communication issues come from the fact that she knows me too well. She likes to anticipate what I’m going to say. Often she will ignore what I actually say and instead answer the question I should have asked.</description>

      <description>It’s been in the wind for a while. Fewer websites are explicitly offering RSS links. Instead they promote their content on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+. I only clung to RSS feeds this long because of the strength of Google Reader. I used it constantly. It was my primary link to the Internet. I was subscribed to about 50 different feeds grouped up into about 10 different folders.</description>

      <description>Is there anything worse than a whining, sniffling, belly aching kid? I think not. Sometimes, It seems like it’s all my kids do. We hear such long suffering complaints as “Vegetables are gross, WAH”, or “I don’t want to do my chores, WAH, WAH”. And my personal favorite, “Why me?, WAH, WAH, WAH”. It seems to go on and on forever. It’s enough to drive a person crazy. It’s no consolation but my kids are not alone.</description>

      <description>Children are unburdened by the ball and chain of experience. They typically see the world for what it is and it isn’t nearly as complicated as we adults seem to think. For example, my youngest son is almost four years old, he has a mind like a trap. He has very concrete expectations for life. He wants to eat when he is hungry and drink when thirsty. Mostly, he wants to play.</description>

This time, my mom, Samie Craddock,has also made a huge contribution. She wrote the lyrics. I received an email from her seemingly out of the blue last November. It included a poem that she had written one day while she was in a particularly cynical mood.</description>

      <description>I sit on my ass approximately 15 hours a day. Can you believe that? Doesn’t that seem a tad excessive? I’m only awake around 18 hours. At first when I did the math, I thought that I must have made a mistake. Nope, I easily sit that long. I guess I wouldn’t care except that recently I’ve started to feel pain in my lower back. Ok, recently is a lie. This back pain has been going on for about six months.</description>

      <description>I was raised to respect my last name. I was taught to be proud of who we are and where we came from. When I was a kid, I thought that I was a member of a secret society. There was a strong sense of family. Being a part of it meant that you would never be alone. We loved each other and still do. I believed that if you shared my blood line then you were a step above.</description>

      <description>Some things quite clearly belong in this world. They come to us in a variety of different packages. We have experienced them at some point with all of our senses. They are easy to identify. When you see them, even for the first time, it is familiar. The taste and smell is pleasant. You could swear that you’ve heard them before. It just feels right. That is how I perceive art.</description>

      <description>Rodney Craddock and I have been recording music together almost constantly since I visited his place a few months ago. While I was there, we threw our first song together in pretty much one day. We wrote the song and recorded all of his parts while I was at his house. We turned on the video camera. We recorded as we played and Rodney used that footage to create a video.</description>

      <description>The concept of property can get complicated. We have plenty of laws regulating it. In fact, the idea of private property is at the heart of our way of living. It seems fair that if you work hard creating something, then you should own it. That isn’t always possible, and some things cannot be owned at all. Or at the very least, it would be silly to consider owning them, for example a cloud, rain or air.</description>

      <description>There is a big difference between knowing what to do and actually doing it. It is easy to wastespend a lot time learning how to use it efficiently. There are dozens of time management systems out there. The one thing that they all have in common is a need of consistency. In order for a time management system to improve your life, you must consistently use it. In other words, you must build habits.</description>

      <description>Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877 in an effort to accurately record sound. He aimed to create a device that could document what was heard much the same way a photograph documented what was seen. It didn’t take long until it became apparent that the primary draw of the phonograph was not to document sound but to be entertained by it.
By the early 1900s, the phonograph was beginning to show up in private homes.</description>

      <description>When I was young, the music that I was allowed to listen to was strictly limited by my parents. Any music purchases must first go through an approval process. The cover art was the first obstacle. My mother would look over the tape cover with a suspicious eye. Anything with pictures of demons, drugs, or violence was out. Anything that might otherwise suggest the devil’s handiwork would quickly get put back on the shelf.</description>

      <description>The family and I made our way down to Montgomery, Texas a few weeks ago. We stayed with my cousin Rodney and his girlfriend Erin for nearly a week. Our goal was to convince them that they should never, ever for any reason have children. Not that there was any talk of kids. Ethan was only too eager to help prevent that conversation from ever happening, ever. Drew made a beeline to the back room where he holed away to play the XBox, rarely to be seen again.</description>

      <description>We ate dinner at seven o’clock. We ate dinner together as a family, at the table, mom’s rules. My spot was at the end of the table directly in front of a wall heater, a prized location in the winter. I sat to the right of my brother Pete and across from mom. This was not some somber formal dining ritual. This was our daily family reunion after a busy day of school or play.</description>

      <description>My hands slipped and the heavy desk slammed into my face. It’s free fall to the concrete was impeded only by this and a knee which is now bruised scarlet. I did manage to save the desk from harm. My face took the brunt of the damage. I stood there frowning as I looked at a split lip in the mirror and felt thankful. For one thing, I was physically capable of standing.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Erik and I am a bibliophile. I have a serious reading problem. I have read countless books, both fiction and nonfiction. I read blogs, news articles, wikipedia entries and comics. I read product reviews on shopping websites. I read the biographies of people I admire or want to emulate. I read about music and on other topics that I desire improved skills. I can easily lose a full day when I run across something new and interesting.</description>

      <description>I’m facing another one of those age milestones in a couple of weeks. I turn 39 next month. This will be the last year of my 30’s. The average lifespan of a male in the United States is about 75 years, but that increases a little bit nearly every year. So I am probably somewhere around halfway finished. I’m still young, relatively speaking. I’ve already experienced so much that I can’t remember it all.</description>

      <description>I spent last Saturday night drinking beer, eating chili and writing music at the home of Nathan and Misti Lanier. Linda and I had been looking forward to a night with adults away from the kids for some time. Unfortunately Linda was inflicted with a sinus infection and ended up staying with her parents along with the kids.
I’m never sure what to expect from a songwriting session. They can go in a lot of different directions.</description>

      <description>The line of demarcation between our physical and internet lives is continually blurring. Many of our activities are obviously shifting to the latter, especially when it comes to communication and entertainment. Music, video, written text, and personal communication are already more prevalent on the web. Before you know it everything that you can’t get directly from the Internet will get dropped shipped to the home you never need to leave. I’ve even read about machines that can print three dimensional objects.</description>

      <description>While reading a blog post about passive income streams, I was presented with the following question: Why do people bother spending time with you? I had to stop and think about this for a little bit. The point of the question is to identify the value that you already bring people. I realize that I don’t really know why people spend time with me. If I think about it, not too many people actually do spend time with me.</description>

      <description>Digital products have a serious flaw, they are infinitely reproducible. Copies can be created in moments at no expense. These copies can be shared indiscriminately. Technology has simplified the process of creating music, books, video, software and just about any product that can be digitized. It is possible for nearly anyone to be an author, musician, director, composer, software developer to name a few. Everything you need to know is freely available on the Internet.</description>

      <description>Is it just me or does everyone hear a thousand chaotic voices muttering in their head all of the time? The voices in my head mostly judge my every move and offer up opinions on the people around me. The opinions vary as do their insistence on being heard. They speak of the feelings and suspicions they have for everyone in my life or in my near vicinity. Neither friends, family or strangers are off limits.</description>

      <description>My History with Music nearly ended twenty years ago when I decided to throw my lot in with the working folks. After high school I decided that college was a waste of not only my time but my parents money. I knew for a fact that I would shrug off class and spend all of my time in more lively pursuits. I figured I could do that without the pretense of school.</description>

      <description>After spending a few days in Yellowstone, it was time to head home. We decided to take a different route back in order to see more of the American west. We exited Yellowstone via the east entrance and took highway 16 to Cody, Wy. We continued on highway 16 with a little trepidation through the Bighorn mountains. We had read reports of sharp curves and steep roads that might tax the breaks.</description>

He had model airplanes on his desk. He played flight simulator games in his spare time. I wasn’t the least bit surprised when I learned that he had begun the process of becoming a pilot. You could see that look in his eyes when he would talk about it.</description>

      <description>After travelling through five states in four days, we were finally at our destination, Yellowstone National Park. By this time we had a well established morning routine. At around 6AM, dad would come tip toeing through the RV attempting to exit without waking the boys (especially Ethan). I would get up and follow him out. We had a coffee pot pre-prepared the night before ready to be brewed. By the time it was ready, mom would join us also in need of caffeine.</description>

      <description>Driving through Wyoming is like touring a spaghetti western movie. At any moment I expected traditionally dressed Arapaho to come riding out on horseback. Dylan and Drew peered out the window, one of them exclaimed “this looks like Red Dead Redemption”. This truly was a perfect picture of how I have always envisioned the Old West high plains. This describes most of the terrain of Wyoming, that is until one reaches the mountains.</description>

Linda, Drew, Ethan and I arrived at my parents house in Anadarko, Ok on Sunday just in time for lunch. Dad and I began pre-departure inspections and were immediately faced with a dead main battery. We were able to get it started with a jump and after some fiddling determined that everything was fine.</description>

      <description>The earliest act of creativity that I can remember came in the form of a comic book. I was by no means a talented artist. The characters I created were the stereotypical products of an eight year old mind. For example my villain was big, bald and ugly. I dubbed him Butch Meaney. It’s a little disconcerting how much I now resemble my early ideal of a bad guy.
My parents, aunts and uncles have ribbed me for that character ever since.</description>

      <description>The terrain of the United States is a complete wonder to me. The aesthetic difference of the east coast from the west and everything in between is like night and day. It varies so much that it is hard to believe that it is all part of the same country. I believe it to be true that we are in part products of our environment. My upbringing in a small peanut and cotton farming community has vastly shaped my view of the world.</description>

      <description>Is there such a thing as a book review that sticks to the facts? I’m sick of reading opinionated reviews that focus on special circumstances. Satisfaction with what we read depends upon our motives. Our current situation and mood dictates our ability to enjoy anything that we do. Many book reviews do nothing more than recommend or discourage reading a particular title with very little reasoning. Half the time owners of bad reviews openly admit to not even finishing the book.</description>

      <description>How many of you would make a donation to my personal bank account in exchange for my behaving in a manner that amused, entertained or was otherwise interesting? I could just behave erratically by doing or saying things inappropriate to my surroundings. We could even take the show on the road, I could travel around just being eccentric. Of course you would all need to pay for this. I, off course, would record each moment and make it available to subscribers for their vicarious living pleasure.</description>

      <description>A theme is established at the beginning of the People’s History of the United States. It begins with Christopher Columbus enslaving, kidnapping and slaughtering the native Americans. It is continued with the African slave trade. It is represented by the protest of war after war, in countless labor strikes and the struggle of many different minority groups for equal consideration. Howard Zinn’s The People’s History is the repetitive recounting of the rich few subjugating the weak majority in the name of democracy, capitalism and freedom.</description>

      <description>It’s not often that Linda and I have a night without the kids so having a full weekend to do what we pleased felt very foreign indeed. This all came about thanks to a late 80’s metal band. Let me explain.
For Christmas, instead of adding to the ever increasing pile of toys, trinkets and equipment in Drew’s room, we decided to give him three months of Drum lessons. I scoured the internet looking for the best instructor I could find that wasn’t too far away.</description>

      <description>[1][Poke the Box][1] is the first book published by the [Domino Project][2]. The book nor the publishing company is easily categorized. A little bit about the Domino Project. What I am reading is that the Domino Project is going to make it easier and faster to produce, promote and distribute books. This is being accomplished by a partnership with Amazon. It is not exactly clear to me how this is different than any other publisher.</description>

      <description>Bluebonnet Elementary school treated the family of its students to an Open House Thursday evening. It was highly anticipated at our house and Drew seemed excited to show us what he had been working on at school. I was already somewhat aware of what I would be seeing as I had been helping him with one of his projects off an on for the prior week. It’s always fun to go to the school and see what the kids have been working on.</description>

      <description>The terms of surrender of private property and personal liberty were never fully agreed upon by all parties. Linda and I, henceforth known as “The parents”, have spent the better part of two years trying to ensure that the life, limb and property of a certain mister Ethan Craddock remain unmolested, much to his annoyance. He seems to consider himself a prisoner, the reluctant prisoner.
A few months ago an incident occurred that made us painfully aware of the drastic measures which needed to take place.</description>

      <description>After a full week of sitting at home due to snow days, life returned to some semblance or normalcy today. At this time last week the sleet was already beating down on my roof. I always work from the home office on Tuesdays but it was pretty apparent that none of us would be leaving the house the next day. This proved to be true for the rest of the week.</description>

      <description>For what felt like the first time in awhile during our Fiesta Bowl road trip, I woke up and everything was perfect. I took a shower and headed down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast and was greeted by several hotel guests donning Crimson and Cream. I was greeted on several occasions with a loud “BOOMER” which I of course replied with an equally loud “SOONER”. Everyone seemed as excited as we were.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to describe the feeling of elation that we all had as we drove away from Roswell in a brand new 2010 Toyota Camry on loan from the dealership. Not that Roswell was such a horrible place, but let’s face it, it is a town that is primarily known for the fact that some of its residents insisted that they had been visited by little green men. That is not exactly an indicator of high culture or sophistication, then again we were passing through there on our way to see grown men run up and down a patch of grass while trying to tackle each other.</description>

      <description>In case you missed it here is the story of the first day of our trip to Glendale Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl.
I woke up Friday morning worried and exhausted after enduring nightmares of our party stranded in the mountains, snowed in with a vehicle that would only travel 2 miles an hour. I was both thankful and terrified once I realized that we were still in Roswell and not about to endure a frigid winter that was sure to end in cannibalism and other unspeakable atrocities.</description>

      <description>There is nothing quite like a road trip across open country to clear your mind, open your eyes to the beauty of the world and test your patience with your travelling companions as well as your fellow occupants of the road.
After learning that a high school class mate of mine had tickets to the Fiesta Bowl for sale, I decided that I would use the remainder of my vacation time to take a trip to Glendale, Arizona and watch the Sooners redeem themselves from their recent BCS Bowl game slump.</description>

      <description>Football season is almost underway again and I have a new favorite team. I am now a die hard Chiefs fan. No not those Chiefs, I’m talking about my sons new football team the [RYA][1] Junior Chiefs. He has played for the bantam Panthers team for the last three years with plenty of ups and downs. Along the way Drew has experienced blood, sweat and tears. He went from mostly watching along the sidelines his first year to being Mr.</description>

6:45 AM : Get in the car and head towards our rendezvous point at Nathan’s house
6:46 AM : Check my text messages from the night before and see that I received a message at 2 AM cancelling….
Ok, so the morning didn’t start off quite the way that we had planned.</description>

      <description>Pretty much spent my whole day trying to get subversion, ahnk, tortoisesvn and visual studio updated. I also began working on a new dialog to Adding Attachments that are not scanned. I’ve also decided that I need to create a user control that rolls up all the attachment functionality.</description>

      <description>so on the way home from work yesterday Nathan and I decided to stop smoking. I had two cigarretes left and it was about 4:30. I smoked the first one immediately after driving off after dropping him off at his house. I smoked the 2nd one at about 7:30 last night. I’ve been losing my mind ever since. By the way it should be noted that I got a text message from Nathan saying that he was not going to quit.</description>

      <description>The drive to work this morning seemed to take forever. I felt like (and honestly still do) I was on the verge of going insane pretty much the entire day. I regretted going to work almost as soon as I got there. I promised dana yesterday that I would finish the search code by tomorrow so I set about getting it done. I finally fixed the dropdown list that for the tables in the sort area.</description>
