      <description>Most people anticipate what you are going to say. Often they will respond to what they think you should have said instead of what you actually say. I suspect that this is the root of many disagreements. We get in to debates where we passionately agree with each other while thinking we are in an argument. Most of us never learned to how to listen.
We spend a good portion of our young lives being educated.</description>

      <description>When you explain your decisions to people, you leave yourself open to their counter arguments. You offer them a problem to solve. By giving them insight into what you are thinking, they have your tacit approval to come up with a workaround. If you know that you are not going to change your mind then stop wasting everyone&amp;rsquo;s time. The best thing to do is to just say no thank you.</description>
