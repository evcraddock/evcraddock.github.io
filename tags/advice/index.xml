      <description>Reading books is a huge part of my world. I am constantly reading and/or listening to several of them at a time. What I like about books is that with a book, an author has enough space to breath. They can go in depth on a subject. We expect them to. This is true for fiction and non fiction. I believe that sitting down with a good book is great way to exercise the brain.</description>

      <description>Most people anticipate what you are going to say. Often they will respond to what they think you should have said instead of what you actually say. I suspect that this is the root of many disagreements. We get in to debates where we passionately agree with each other while thinking we are in an argument. Most of us never learned to how to listen.
We spend a good portion of our young lives being educated.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Explain - Keep your own counsel</title>

      <description>When you explain your decisions to people, you leave yourself open to their counter arguments. You offer them a problem to solve. By giving them insight into what you are thinking, they have your tacit approval to come up with a workaround. If you know that you are not going to change your mind then stop wasting everyone&amp;rsquo;s time. The best thing to do is to just say no thank you.</description>
