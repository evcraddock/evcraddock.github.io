      <description>Music has become so ubiquitous that it has mostly lost it&amp;rsquo;s luster. Gone are the days when your music collection defined you as a person. Gone are the days when listening to music was an actual past time. Music is now a commodity. It is the noise that acts as the sound track for our lives. This is hardly even debatable at this point. I know that there are still insurgent music listeners out there, little pockets of resistance who probably sit around their record players soaking in the ambiance.</description>
